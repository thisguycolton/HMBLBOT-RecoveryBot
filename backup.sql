1	content	<div>The fellowship I found in A.A. enabled me to face my problem honestly and squarely. I couldn’t do it among my relatives; I couldn’t do it among my friends. No one likes to admit that they’re a drunk, that they can’t control this thing. But when we come into A.A., we can face our problem honestly and openly. I went to closed meetings and open meetings. And I took everything that A.A. had to give me. Easy does it, first things first, one day at a time. It was at that point that I reached surrender. I heard one very ill woman say that she didn’t believe in the surrender part of the A.A. program. My heavens! Surrender to me has meant the ability to run my home, to face my responsibilities as they should be faced, to take life as it comes to me day by day and work my problems out. That’s what surrender has meant to me. I surrendered once to the bottle, and I couldn’t do these things. Since I gave my will over to A.A., whatever A.A. has wanted of me I’ve tried to do to the best of my ability. When I’m asked to go out on a call, I go. I’m not going; A.A. is leading me there. A.A. gives us alcoholics direction into a way of life without the need for alcohol. That life for me is lived one day at a time, letting the problems of the future rest with the future. When the time comes to solve them, God will give me strength for that day. </div>	Reading	1	2023-10-26 00:45:28.911097	2023-10-26 00:45:28.911097

3	content	<div><strong> Let’s look at Sam’s experience: </strong><br><br></div><div>I have learned from experience that staying abstinent, working the Program, and attending meetings through painful times is a guarantee of personality change. We no longer have to escape our pain through using. The Program has given us a previous tool—humility—which, used regularly, will transform pain into growth. Armed with humility, we who once dreaded change as much as death can learn to face real life with a new courage and hope. <br><br></div><div>Before I entered the fellowship, I lived in a fantasy world of my own creation. I attempted to control not only effort but outcomes of situations. I tried to keep myself calm with chemicals and food, with no recognition for the ups and downs of daily living. I was seeking an unreal world of complete security, romance, and approval, and the more I tried to control (demand) these things, the more chaos I created. It becomes clear to us in getting sober that we have to change. I like what Bill W. has to say about these rude awakenings in this passage from the Twelve and Twelve: <br><br></div><div>And as we grow spiritually, we find that our old attitudes toward our instincts need to undergo drastic revisions. Our desires for emotional security and wealth, for personal prestige and power, for romance, and for family satisfactions—all these have to be tempered and redirected. We have learned that the satisfaction of instincts cannot be the sole end and aim of our lives. If we place instincts first, we have got the cart before the horse; we shall be pulled backward into disillusionment. But when we are willing to place spiritual growth first—then and only then do we have a real chance. (page 114) <br><br></div><div>Humility seems to be the basic ingredient for transforming pain into growth. In Step Seven of the Twelve and Twelve, humility is defined as the “perspective to see that character building and spiritual values have to come first, and that material satisfactions are not the purpose of living.” We learn that an honest desire to seek and do God’s will is necessary for humility. <br><br></div><div>“What an order. I can’t go through with it,” used to be my initial reaction to growing through the Steps. I could accept solutions intellectually, but when it came to practical application, I had trouble. I know today that I don’t have to do it perfectly; it takes time to get better. I know that I don’t have to do it alone, that I have a wealth of wisdom and support in this fellowship at my disposal, and that gives me hope for change, growth, and new frontiers. </div><div><br></div>	Reading	2	2023-10-26 00:47:18.580541	2023-10-26 00:47:18.580541

5	content	<div> You may be familiar with some version of the Drop the Rock parable. It’s about the Twelve Step group members who set sail on the ship Recovery across the sea of Life for the island of Serenity. As the parable is usually told, soon after the boat pulls away from the dock, the passengers realize that some of their friends are not yet on board. <br><br></div><div> Sure enough, their friend Mary comes running down the street and onto the dock. The people on the boat cheer her on. “Dive in and swim, Mary!” they shout. “You can do it!” Mary dives into the water and swims for the boat as fast and hard as she can. But as she gets close to the boat, she slows and struggles to stay afloat. Everyone on board can see why: a heavy rock is hanging from a snarl of strings around Mary’s neck. “Drop the rock!” they all shout. “Let go! Drop the rock!” <br><br></div><div> Treading water, Mary looks down at the rock. She realizes it contains her fear, resentments, self-pity, anger, intolerance, resentments, and other character flaws. She also realizes that if she doesn’t let go of them, she will drown. <br><br></div><div> She tears off the strings, holds the rock away from her body, and lets it go. <br><br></div><div> Freed of the heavy and useless weight, Mary easily swims the rest of the way to the boat. She climbs aboard, dripping and deeply relieved. When most people tell this story, this is where they stop. That’s understandable, because that part alone is useful and instructive. <br><br></div><div> But here’s how that parable might continue: As Mary is drying off, she notices something heavy in her pants pocket. She reaches in and discovers another rock, although much smaller than the one she’d just released. She recognizes this as her character defect of self-centeredness and immediately tosses it into the water. <br><br></div><div> As everyone congratulates Mary, they look back toward shore. Someone else is in the water, swimming desperately toward the boat. But that person, too, is being pulled underwater after every few strokes. As the swimmer gets closer to the boat, Mary can see that it’s Ramon, her old friend and—before they went through treatment together—drinking buddy. <br><br></div><div> Mary runs to the rail, leans over, and shouts, “Hey, Ramon, it’s me, Mary! Drop the rock! Can you see the ripples from the rocks I just dropped? We don’t have to carry around our character defects any more. If I can do it, you can!” <br><br></div><div> As the ripples from Mary’s rocks reach Ramon, he pulls the strings off his shoulders and raises his hand above his head in a thumbs-up. <br><br></div><div> “You’re almost there!” Mary shouts. <br><br></div><div> “I’m coming!” Ramon shouts back. <br><br></div><div> He dives under the ripples and disappears. Half a minute later, his head pops out of the water, only thirty feet from the boat. <br><br></div><div> He disappears beneath the water again. Everyone on board watches breathlessly. <br><br></div><div> Then suddenly Ramon appears next to the boat, just below Mary. He gasps, “Help me in!” <br><br></div><div> Mary leans over, stretches out her arm, and pulls Ramon aboard. </div><div><br></div>	Reading	3	2023-10-26 00:48:52.014974	2023-10-26 00:48:52.014974

7	content	<div>The Big Book doesn’t teach us hundreds of different things; it teaches us a small number of things hundreds of times. And those few things are presented in a sequence. When most of us began working the Steps, we saw them as simply a list, much like the Ten Commandments. Now, however, we understand that the <em>specific sequence of the Twelve Steps is the transformative element of the Program. </em>The Twelve Steps are a unified, interdependent whole, not a collection of twelve separate items. Each Step requires and builds on <em>all</em> of the earlier Steps.<br><br>As the Big Book explains on page xxii, the Twelve Steps <em>trace exactly the same path to recovery that was blazed by the earliest members of Alcoholics Anonymous.</em> That paragraph also makes clear that <em>The Twelve Steps . . . summarize the program.<br></em><br>Step One is the truth about the problem: it gets our attention and gives meaning to our struggle. Step Two is the truth about the solution, based on the truth about the problem. Step Three is the truth about what blocks us from experiencing a solution. Steps Four through Nine get us unblocked. Steps Ten through Twelve keep us unblocked. Or, to put it another way: Step One is where we were. Step Two is where we wanted to be. Steps Three through Nine are how we get well. And Steps Ten through Twelve are how we stay well.<br><br>As old-timers Joe and Charlie pointed out in their workshops and in their book <em>A Program for You</em>, the Big Book is organized in a very deliberate sequence. Because it is a textbook for recovery, it is meant to be read and studied in that sequence. And that sequence begins this way: <em>We have a problem. The problem defines the solution. And there are prescribed actions that can bring about a solution.<br></em><br>Most of us in recovery know a number of Twelve Step slogans, such as “First Things First,” “Easy Does It,” and “It Works if You Work It.” Each of these can be helpful and inspiring at various points in our recovery. But we get the most benefit from them as guideposts to a new way of life in the context of this simple three-part template of <em>problem, solution, and program of action provided by the Twelve Steps.</em><br><br>If we practice each of the Steps as an individual strategy, they may give us some benefit and relief. But for them to become an unshakable foundation for living, the Steps must be practiced in the order in which they were written and <em>lived into</em> over a lifetime.</div>	Reading	4	2023-10-26 02:16:18.998685	2023-10-26 02:16:18.998685

9	content	<div>Last year I fulfilled a dream I’ve had since I was a boy—I began singing in an Anglican choir. For eight months, it was one of the most fulfilling things I’d ever done.<br><br>I live out in the country, and my church is in the city, about forty-five miles away. This meant driving ninety miles on Wednesday nights and Saturday afternoons for rehearsals—and, of course, on Sunday mornings and high holidays.<br><br>I’ve been in recovery over eleven years. I know that I’m still powerless over alcohol, but I no longer want to drink. Alcohol and a self-centered life nearly destroyed me and my family. I go to two meetings a week and haven’t missed one in years.<br><br>But I did miss a Wednesday night choir rehearsal. I came down with a stomach bug, so I called the choir director and she agreed that the best thing was for me to stay home.<br><br>I went to Saturday rehearsal as usual, but on Sunday our car didn’t start, so I missed church. Then, three days later, our water heater sprang a serious leak a few minutes before it was time to leave for the city. By the time I had everything cleaned up, I knew I’d arrive shortly before rehearsal ended, so I stayed home.<br><br>After that, my momentum was gone. When Saturday morning came, I was surprisingly resistant. All I could think about was the ninety-mile trip and how long and tedious it would be. I <em>really </em>didn’t want to go—even though I still really enjoyed singing. I found myself thinking, <em>Maybe I should quit the choir.</em><br><br>Something about that thought made me stop and examine it. Its tone was vaguely familiar. After a minute or two, I recognized the voice. It was a voice I hadn’t heard in years. It was the voice that had said, early in my recovery, <em>Maybe you should quit the Program. Go have a drink instead.</em><br><br>That’s when I realized that sustained momentum is part of what drives recovery. And Step Ten is partly about sustaining momentum. I threw myself into the car and started driving to church.<br><br>I made sure to get to every one of the next several rehearsals, and kept checking myself daily to see if my momentum had returned. It took a few weeks, but eventually it did. I thank God that, over the last eleven years, I never lost my momentum in going to meetings or practicing the Steps.</div>	Reading	5	2023-11-02 02:42:00.412232	2023-11-02 02:42:00.412232

11	content	<div>As beloved AA speaker Chuck C. has observed, when we first began working the Program, we thought that alcohol (or drugs, or overeating, or whatever) was our problem, because we have a body that can’t tolerate it, coupled with a mind that can’t leave it alone.<br><br>But when we first used alcohol, it wasn’t a problem for us—it was an answer. That’s why we drank—or shot up, or overate, or gambled away our savings. This means that our foundational problem existed before we began drinking or drugging or overeating.<br><br>By the time we reach Step Ten, we clearly understand what that foundational problem is: <em>overreliance on self.</em> That was our single biggest character defect, and for much or our life, it blocked us from having a spiritual experience.<br><br>I smile when I hear people refer to the Twelve Steps as a self-help program, because it’s exactly the opposite. Our “selves” need help.<em> The Twelve Steps teach us how and when to ask for help from a Higher Power</em>— not how to rely more on the self and self-centeredness.<br><br>When we reach Step Ten, we are no longer drinking or using or overeating. But something much greater has also occurred: we’ve sobered up to our humanness—to our limitations. We’ve also sobered up to our need to grow and serve on an ongoing basis. We know that we cannot simply settle for chemical relief. We know that if chemical relief is all we focus on, we have taken the first step toward relapse.<br><br>As we work Step Ten, we also come to understand some subtle aspects of the Program that are not generally visible to newcomers. Our attitude toward the Steps has shifted—and continues to shift—in profound ways. Let’s look closely at some of these shifts.</div>	Reading	6	2023-11-09 00:03:29.822804	2023-11-09 00:03:29.822804
17	content	<div>This story involves me and a former boss, who I’ll call Evelyn. This took place when she was new to the job and wanted to make some changes. Many of these were good changes. But Evelyn also wanted to change how the duties of my job were configured. This surprised me, because I’d always gotten good performance reviews from Wally, my previous boss, and good to great evaluations from the people I worked with. It seemed to me that Evelyn was trying to fix something that wasn’t broken. Worse, it looked to me like her proposed changes would make me less effective—and less happy in my job, because they would give me far less flexibility.<br><br>I asked to meet with Evelyn, and I explained to her exactly what I just explained to you. She listened and then said, “I understand. The thing is, Louis, you only get to see the people you work with. You don’t get to see the bigger picture. Seeing that is my job. I understand that the changes will have some negative effects on you. But they’ll support larger positive changes for the organization as a whole. You’ll lose some flexibility, but our customers will gain in consistency and reliability.”<br><br>Despite my decades of recovery, I responded entirely out of self-interest—quickly and mindlessly. I said, “Why do I have to be the sacrificial lamb?” Which was, of course, wildly overstating my potential loss and pain. A better question would have been, <em>Can we try to find some ways to create that consistency and reliability that will have less of a negative impact on me?</em><br><br>I don’t recall my posture or body language at that moment. But I’m sure my tone of voice was tense, if not outright angry— and I was definitely rippling out unpleasant energy.<br><br>Evelyn felt it. She frowned and said, “I don’t need you to be Jesus on the cross. I <em>do</em> need you to be a team player. That’s part of your job description.”<br><br>This was now officially an argument. I said to her angrily, “I’ve always been a team player.”<br><br>She nodded and said, “I know you have. That’s one of the reasons you continue to work here. Now please <em>stay </em>a team player.” She stood up and said, “Louis, this discussion is over.”<br><br>I walked back to my office. I was seething. Mindlessly, self-centeredly, indulgently seething.<br><br>At that moment, I was powerless over my anger and my sense of betrayal. I had also completely lost perspective. Evelyn was asking me to take a real but relatively small hit—to make my schedule more rigid, and to make my life a little more difficult. But at the time I felt like I’d been gut-punched. It didn’t occur to me at all to ask for spiritual direction, or to ask my Higher Power to remove my anger and self-righteousness.<br><br>Over the next few days, Evelyn and I had two more tense conversations on the subject. As I thought about the changes she wanted to implement, I couldn’t see how they benefited anyone— not our customers, not our organization, and not any of the people who worked for it. She seemed to be adding regimentation entirely for its own sake—or maybe just to please herself. At one point I even said as much to her. She responded by shaking her head and saying, “Now I know why Wally resigned.”<br><br>Then I got a call from <em>her </em>boss, LeShaun. Evelyn had gone to him and asked him to intervene. She was as frustrated as I was. To her great credit, she didn’t just fire me—although, at the time, I half expected her to.<br><br>LeShaun suggested that the three of us meet in his office a few days later. I agreed.<br><br>During those few days, I happened to reread one of my favorite passages from Emmet Fox’s book <em>The Sermon on the Mount:</em><br><br><br></div><blockquote>If, when someone is behaving badly, instead of thinking of the trouble, you will immediately switch your attention off from the human to the Divine, and concentrate upon God, or upon the Real Spiritual Self of the person in question, you will find —if you really do this—that his conduct will immediately change. This is the secret of handling difficult people. . . . If people are troublesome, you have only to change your thought about them, and then they will change too . . .</blockquote><div><br><br>That knocked some sense back into me. I realized what I’d been doing, and I vowed to show up in LeShaun’s office giving off very different ripples. I told myself I’d follow Fox’s suggestion as closely as I could.<br><br>When I got to LeShaun’s office, Evelyn was already there. I took a deep breath, mentally asked for spiritual direction, and walked in.<br><br>From the beginning, LeShaun treated the two of us as colleagues who weren’t getting along, not as boss and subordinate. That helped me—and, presumably, Evelyn—feel safe.<br><br>First LeShaun asked Evelyn to explain the situation from her viewpoint. She did, laying out her case clearly and a bit forcefully, but not unfairly. As she spoke, I mentally held her in the purest light of her true spiritual nature. I kept silent and simply sat there—relaxed, attentive, and open.<br><br>When she was done, LeShaun asked me to tell my own story. So I did—calmly and straightforwardly, without trying to argue my case or control the outcome, and without getting upset. Throughout it all, I mentally held Evelyn in a kind of spiritual halo. <br><br>LeShaun looked thoughtful. He asked each of us one or two follow-up questions. Then he leaned forward and said, “Sitting with me in my office are two caring, committed employees who want the best for this enterprise and for the people it serves. While it sounds like the two of you developed some heat under your collars, it’s also clear to me that your disagreement is over how to best be of service. It’s not about turf or personalities. I thank you both for that.”<br><br>Then he offered a solution—a brilliant solution, really—that allowed me to keep 90 percent of my flexibility while also giving Evelyn the continuity and standardization she felt were so important. Plus, it was better for our customers than either the status quo or Evelyn’s proposed changes.

13	content	<div>As we work Step Ten and it becomes integrated into our life, we let go of trying to control the world—or other people.<br><br>We see that our former strategies of demanding, dominating, manipulating, wheedling, flattering, and people pleasing were all forms of overreliance on self. We also come to see that these strategies were the source of most of our (and anyone’s) defective interactions.<br><br>Now, as we practice Step Ten, we stop looking to others to fulfill us. Instead, we focus on how we can be of service—while also noticing and acknowledging our own needs.<br><br>Being of service doesn’t mean becoming a doormat. It’s exactly the opposite. We learn to become assertive instead of aggressive or dependent. Instead of trying to get others to do what we want, we do whatever is compassionate, or just, or most appropriate for the situation.<br><br>We also speak the truth about who we are and what we’re feeling. We learn what our real needs are, and we learn to express them clearly and directly, without trying to manipulate others into fulfilling them. We understand that assertiveness is our perfect right—as well as the antidote to the demands we used to make of others.<br><br>We are also aware that we can never know exactly how others will respond. When we express ourselves and our needs clearly and directly, they might happily accommodate us. Or they might say “Not gonna happen” or “Not interested” or “Screw you for asking” or even “Screw you for needing that.”<br><br>Throughout my drinking years and during the first few years of my recovery, I was a compulsive people pleaser. I would do whatever I felt would make others happy and comfortable, in the hope that they would think favorably of me. This was one of my biggest character defects. It was also a subtle form of domination, because I was trying to get everybody else to do my bidding. Through my people pleasing, I demanded that others meet a need in me, which was to be liked. <em>I was focused on myself, and I compulsively tried to get others to focus on me as well.</em><br><br>Bill W. had the very same character defect. In his 1958 <em>Grapevine </em>article “The Next Frontier: Emotional Sobriety,” he observed that his own painful dependencies caused him to demand that other people in AA meet his needs. Repeatedly, he tried to get others to do his bidding and depend upon him. Eventually he recognized that he lacked <em>emotional sobriety.</em> From an emotional standpoint, he was still acting like an addict.<br><br>During those years when I too lacked emotional sobriety, I radiated an essence of neediness and unsteadiness that blocked me from having a spiritual experience. Now imagine the essence you radiate when you simply show up as yourself in a spirit of compassion and service, and let other people know exactly who you are and what you feel.<br><br>Over time, as we work Step Ten, one of the things that changes is the essence of what we radiate. Some people call it a vibe or an intangible influence. This is the energy behind the Ripple Effect.</div>	Reading	7	2023-11-16 01:58:55.526414	2023-11-16 01:58:55.526414

15	content	<div>As part of working Step Ten, we learn to pay attention to our emotions as they arise in each new moment.<br><br>When used properly, our emotions help us stay alive and healthy. Fear keeps us safe. Guilt prevents us from repeating a harmful action. Awe keeps us humble and grateful. In a balanced life, our emotions serve as valuable and faithful indicators of how we’re living and how we’re using our free will. They often also point to what we’re planning to do next—and, sometimes, to what we need to do instead.<br><br>Before we began working the Steps, we viewed our emotions as a posse of friends and a group of enemies. Our life consisted mostly of wanting to experience pleasant emotions and avoid unpleasant ones.<br><br>Now, however, we realize that this was a hallmark of our lack of emotional sobriety. We also understand that simply trying to feel good is a road that leads to relapse. In working Step Ten, we let go of the distinction of <em>pleasant </em>and <em>unpleasant</em>, and instead we focus on whether an emotion points toward a <em>sustainable </em>or <em>unsustainable </em>recovery and life.<br><br>The emotions that point us toward a sustainable life are themselves sustainable. No matter how much of them we experience, they continue to support our lives. Sustainable emotions include peace of mind, connectedness, love, compassion, joy, serenity, and peace.<br><br>The emotions that lead us toward an unsustainable life are themselves inherently unsustainable. The more they grow, the more they can get in the way. The most common unsustainable emotions are the unpleasant ones: shame, guilt, remorse, resentment, anger, rage, irritability, and so on. Quite a few are forms of fear, such as anxiety, unease, panic, and terror. When we feel these emotions briefly, we pay attention to them, identify their source and whether they’re cues to some action we need to take to regain balance in our lives, and then we let them go. Treated this way, they’re not a problem. However, if we cling to them and keep feeding them, eventually they will harm us—and, often, allow us to harm others.<br><br>But there’s another group of emotions that are equally unsustainable— yet they feel pleasant, at least at first. These include arrogance, overconfidence, excessive pride, superiority, self-righteousness, and hubris. Others include the relief we feel when we avoid discovery or punishment for acting badly and the pleasure we take in someone else’s pain or failure. (The German language actually has a word for this: <em>Schadenfreude</em>.)<br><br>We work Step Ten with the unshakable knowledge (faith) that we can’t live a sustainable life with a primary focus on self. Knowing this, we carefully observe our own emotions on an ongoing basis. We nurture those that, in turn, will nurture a sustainable life and recovery. We also notice those that will not; we take the appropriate actions if needed and then let them go. All the while, we keep in mind that <em>the more we sustain our recovery, the more it sustains us.</em></div>	Reading	8	2023-11-23 02:00:35.369745	2023-11-23 02:00:35.369745

25	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div>So far, I’ve spoken of the Ripple Effect as something that ripples out from one person to another. But as we keep working Step Ten, we learn to notice the Ripple Effect operating <em>inside </em>us. This occurs in multiple ways—five, at least.<br><br>First, when we’re living a life of service and carrying out the will of our Higher Power, we can feel the rightness of it in our own body. (This doesn’t mean it always feels easy or comfortable. Sometimes it may feel just the opposite.)<br><br>Second, over time we’ll not only feel that we are rippling out into the universe, but that the universe is rippling through us, expressing itself through us. This may be accompanied by a sense that we are in exactly in the right place, doing just what we need to do.<br><br>Third, as we work Step Ten and our recovery continues, a process of neurological healing takes place in our brain. New neural pathways get created and strengthened; old, harmful ones atrophy and disappear. An internal Ripple Effect literally heals our brain.<br><br>Fourth, as we develop our presence and internal awareness, we get better at tracking the subtle processes through which emotions and impulses arise in our body. Instead of mindlessly letting them ripple out through reactivity, we examine them. We discern the needs behind them. We choose our response based on the unique details and relationships of that moment. We work the appropriate Step. As necessary, we ask our Higher Power for help and guidance. We also learn to notice when we are impatient and distracted, not bringing our full presence to the moment. This awareness enables us to do an internal reset—and quickly return to the here and now.<br><br>Fifth, we become aware of more and more aspects of our personality that we were blind to before.</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	13	2024-01-04 01:10:06.529742	2024-01-24 20:55:39.356892

21	content	<div>The Big Book provides us with specific directions for working Step Ten, as well as some clear promises and warnings. When we follow its directions, we live into the promises. When we don’t, we live into the warnings.<br><br>On pages 84 and 85, the Big Book promises us eight outcomes, which I’ve numbered here as a list.<br><br>1. And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone—even alcohol (or any other addiction).<br><br>2. For by this time sanity will have returned.<br><br>3. We will seldom be interested in liquor [or whatever substance or activity fueled our addiction].<br><br>4. If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame.<br><br>5. We react sanely and normally, and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor [or any other addictive substance or activity] has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it.<br><br>6. We’re not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality—safe and protected. We have not even sworn off.<br><br>7. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. 8. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid.<br><br>The Big Book goes on to tell us that all this becomes the reality of our life, “. . . so long as we keep in fit spiritual condition.”<br><br>How do we stay in fit spiritual condition? By living according to these clear directions (page 85): “Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of God’s will into all of our activities.” Instead of constantly asking <em>What do I want? </em>as we did when we lived in the grip of self-centeredness, we ask,<br><br></div><blockquote>“How can I best serve Thee—Thy will (not mine) be done.” These are the thoughts that must go with us constantly. We can exercise our willpower along this line all we wish. It is the proper use of the will.</blockquote><div><br>The Big Book has just warned us that because we now live in the world of the Spirit,<br><br></div><blockquote>. . . It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels. We’re headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe. We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve, contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.</blockquote><div><br>And that’s true not only for alcoholism, but for any addiction, including our addiction to self-centeredness. Self-reliance, self-sacrifice, and other forms of self-centeredness are also subtle foes. Because they can creep in in exactly the same way, we need a daily reprieve from these as well. Step Ten is the ongoing practice that, day by day and moment by moment, prepares us for that reprieve. As the Big Book reminds us on page 83, “The spiritual life is not a theory. <em>We have to live it.</em>”</div>	Reading	11	2023-12-14 01:33:16.850048	2023-12-14 01:33:16.850048

23	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div>If you’re in a committed relationship, you may notice another distinction as you work Step Ten.<br><br>In long-term partnerships, usually one partner’s needs primarily get taken care of. I call this person the project. The other partner, who primarily takes care of the project’s needs, can be called the project manager. Projects like being taken care of. Project managers like taking care of them.<br><br>This arrangement can be perfectly healthy, since we all go about life getting our needs met through some dominance and some dependence. In fact, it often creates a good footprint for a family. In a generally healthy couple, it generates a balanced partnership out of two people’s natural differences.<br><br>In a less healthy couple, however, the person with the overdeveloped sense of dependence becomes the 24/7 project, while the partner with the overdeveloped sense of dominance becomes the 24/7 project manager. The classic example is the addict and the codependent.<br><br>In practice, things are often more nuanced. For instance, one member of a couple might be the financial project manager in the relationship, while the other is the emotional project manager. One partner might manage most of the couple’s relationships with neighbors, while the other manages most relationships with extended family. The roles of project and project manager can also shift over time, for example, in an emergency when one partner has a long-term illness, or as couples age.<br><br>In couples—especially those with kids—the project manager is the primary caregiver. In part this is because most primary caregivers are hardwired to protect their kids and their families. And, in most couples, the primary caregiver also serves as the family’s project manager in another way, providing much of the emotional security.<br><br>In American culture, the role of primary caregiver is often represented stereotypically by a female. Listen to a dozen random country western songs sung by males. Many of them will involve a man struggling to feel emotionally safe and secure through his dependence on a woman.<br><br>As we work Step Ten and recovery becomes more and more of a way of life for us, these differences become increasingly visible. Project/project manager relationships—whether balanced or imbalanced—aren’t just a heterosexual relationship phenomenon, of course. These roles tend to evolve in all committed couples, whether they’re straight, gay, or otherwise. All of us are variations on the same theme: human being.</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	12	2023-12-28 01:33:55.552869	2024-01-24 20:56:26.875566

27	content	<div> The Serenity Prayer is one of the Program’s most concentrated sources of inspiration and guidance. It is also one of the most beloved and often quoted. Here is the most common version:<br><br></div><blockquote>God grant me the serenity<br>To accept the things I cannot change;<br>The courage to change the things I can;<br>And the wisdom to know the difference.</blockquote><div><br>This version of the prayer sets up a duality: the things we can change and the things we cannot. But the Ripple Effect teaches us that these are not our only options.<br><br>In Step One we admitted that our addiction was not something we could cure, or manage, or otherwise change for the better. Then, in Step Two, we admitted that we could not become saner or more spiritual on our own. We also understood that as we worked Steps Three through Nine—especially Steps Six and Seven—we would have a spiritual experience and a transformation would occur. But we also understood that we could not make these things happen. <em>They would happen to us</em>.<br><br>The Ripple Effect is the opposite of trying to control or manipulate the world. It is about showing up, speaking, and acting in a way that— somehow—sets the stage for positive change, often in ways we can’t plan or predict.<br><br>In recognition of the Ripple Effect, here’s another version of the Serenity Prayer to capture its spirit:<br><br></div><blockquote>God grant me the serenity<br>To accept the things I cannot change;<br>The courage to change the things I can;<br>And the wisdom to also do the things I can<br>That will bring about the changes I can’t.</blockquote><div><br>This is the essence of Steps Six and Seven. When we work them for the first time, we understand that it is not possible for us, on our own, to get rid of our shortcomings and character defects. Our Higher Power must do that for us.<br><br>Yet in order to work those Steps—and for them to work on and through us—we also have to act, by asking our Higher Power to remove those flaws. We have to ask for the necessary events to ripple through us. We make a willful commitment to no longer do things the way we used to—and an equally willful commitment to accept whatever happens next.

19	content	<div>Our emotions offer us a continuous opportunity to know if what we’re doing, thinking, or planning is sustainable or unsustainable. They give us immediate and constant feedback about how we’re using our free will—or how we’re about to use it.<br><br>Our emotions are also very reliable indicators of when we need to practice Step Ten. Whenever an unsustainable emotion arises, and stays with us more than briefly, that’s a sign that Step Ten is called for. As we practice paying attention to our emotions day by day, we get a very accurate measure of what’s working in our life—and what’s not. In Step Ten, <em>as we continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear</em>, we learn to become better observers of ourselves. With practice, we get better and better at these directions:<br><br></div><ol><li>Noticing any harm we create <em>as soon as we create it</em>—and making amends as soon as possible.</li><li> Recognizing unsustainable thoughts, emotions, and impulses when they first appear.</li><li>Noticing ever smaller and more subtle manifestations of those emotions, thoughts, and impulses.</li><li> Intuiting the probable outcome of embracing or following each one.</li><li> Restraining ourselves from doing harm to ourselves and others.</li><li>Asking our Higher Power to remove whatever shortcomings and character defects we observe—and to give us guidance for what to do next.</li><li>Acting out of the best parts of ourselves—with the guidance of our spiritual direction—instead of from our self-direction.</li></ol><div><br></div><div>In working Step Ten, we apply our free will by choosing which thoughts, impulses, and emotions to act on and which ones to let go. We quickly let go of unpleasant and unsustainable emotions as if they were a hot flame. We also recognize that certain pleasurable emotions—selfcongratulation, excessive pride, superiority, and their counterparts—as just as unsustainable as jealousy, rage, resentment, or self-pity.<br><br>As a result, as we work Step Ten, our transgressions become less frequent. When we do fall prey to the subtle foe of self-interest, we generally create smaller crises and less damaging situations—and we usually learn something important from them.

I was just beginning to do Step Ten. I’d been in recovery for maybe five or six months.</p>\r\n<p>I was doing the right things, and feeling good. I had a lot to be grateful for. But on that day—I remember it was a Saturday afternoon—I wasn’t feeling grateful at all. My boyfriend Roberto was at his parents’ house with our daughter, Ariella, and our black Labrador retrievers, and I was home alone. All of a sudden this terrible funk hit me, completely out of nowhere.</p>\r\n<p><br>This was a new form of misery for me. It wasn’t the misery of a hangover or a craving. Or the misery of guilt because I’d done something thoughtless and mean. It had no source at all that I could see. I remember thinking, <em>What the hell? I thought I was on a glorious path of joyous and serene sobriety.</em> I kind of assumed I would never feel bad again. Which, looking back, is silly—but it’s how I felt right then.</p>\r\n<p><br>I also felt like I was exuding misery. I was relieved that Roberto and Ariella weren’t home and didn’t see what a wreck I was. I finally thought, <em>Okay, I’ve got to do something. What can I do?</em></p>\r\n<p><br>I decided to go to the park, just to breathe in some nature and be out in the world.</p>\r\n<p><br>Almost as soon as I got to the park, a couple of half-grown golden retrievers ran up to me, wagging their tails and licking my hands. I love my Labs, but I love goldens even more. These two were super happy, and they obviously wanted me to throw something. So I threw a stick, and they both went charging after it.<br>I heard their owner calling them. I looked and saw a man who looked a little like my dad. He was with his daughter, who was about Ariella’s age, maybe twelve or thirteen. I could see she had Down syndrome.</p>\r\n<p><br>I went over to them and told them about my Labs, and the girl got excited. She said, “I adore Labs!” She pointed to the goldens and said, “The orange guys are Bonnie and Clyde. My dad named them after criminals. He’s weird.” She handed me a stick and picked up one of her own. She said to me, “We need to throw and fetch until they’re tired out.” I looked at her dad. He just smiled and said, “All true.”</p>\r\n<p><br>The three of us spent the next half hour hurling sticks across the lawn until our arms hurt. By then the dogs had had enough too, and just stood there panting. The girl said to me, “You want to know something? Bonnie and Clyde are both boys, but with their you-know-whats cut off. My dad named them. He’s weird.”<br>Her father shrugged and said, “Yup, I’m weird. Okay, Jocelyn, let’s blow this pop stand.” They leashed the dogs, waved goodbye, and walked off.</p>\r\n<p><br>By now I was feeling good. The energy of the girl and the dogs was contagious, and all the throwing had released endorphins in my body. I walked home smiling, amazed at what had just happened.

35	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>    I used to be a serious pot smoker. I lit up pretty much every day, sometimes two or three times. I was also a pretty heavy drinker. Am I an addict? At a certain point I decided it didn’t matter—I just needed my life to be manageable. I needed to do something before everything fell completely to pieces. That’s when I started going to MA (Marijuana Anonymous) and AA meetings.</p>\r\n<p>    The Program has worked well for me. I’ve been drug- and alcohol-free for just over three years. Life isn’t perfect, but it’s good. And it really helps to have a clear head.</p>\r\n<p>    Here’s what happened just two weeks ago. I’m reading in the library, in one of its big cushioned chairs. I feel something shift in my pocket and fall out. So I stand up and, sure enough, my keys are gone.</p>\r\n<p>    I pull off the bottom cushion of the chair. There are my keys —along with a bag of weed, maybe half an ounce.</p>\r\n<p>    My first thought is, <em>Wow, it’s a gift from the gods. My second is, Don’t be an idiot. You know you’ll regret it if you light up. My third is, I don’t have to smoke it. I can sell it. If it’s good stuff, it’s worth sixty or seventy bucks. </em>All this goes through my head in about two seconds. </p>\r\n<p>    Then my good sense returns. I stuff the bag and my keys into my coat pocket and head for the men’s room. I dump the pot into the toilet and flush it.</p>\r\n<p>    I go back and start reading again, but now I’m feeling <em>really </em>uncomfortable. How could I even <em>think </em>about using again? Or worse, dealing? I feel like I’ve committed some terrible Twelve Step sin. And then I think, <em>Have I just taken the first step toward relapse? </em></p>\r\n<p>    I take out my phone and call my sponsor. I say to him, “Brent, can you talk? I feel terrible, like I just stole toys from Santa Claus or something.”</p>\r\n<p>    He laughs and says, “Okay, tell me what happened.”</p>\r\n<p>    So I tell him the story and say, “I know I need to do a Tenth Step about this. Can you help me think it through?”</p>\r\n<p>    Brent is silent for a couple of seconds. Then he says, “Working Step Ten is a good idea. But I’d say you’ve only committed one wrong, and it’s not the one you think. You’re trying to punish yourself for being human.”</p>\r\n<p>    This is completely not what I’m expecting. I say, “Come again?” My sponsor says, “Remember what the Big Book says? <em>If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame.</em> That’s exactly what you did. Nothing in the Program says that it’s wrong to feel tempted. In fact, the sentence I just quoted implies that we likely <em>will </em>be tempted. That’s what I love about the Program. It allows us to be human. It assumes we’re going to be human. It doesn’t demand perfection. It focuses on spiritual progress, not spiritual perfection.”</p>\r\n<p>    I say to him, “So it’s not a shortcoming to be tempted?” “No,” he says. “It’s a shortcoming to act on that temptation. But, you know, it’s also a shortcoming to expect that you’ll never be tempted. You’re showing yourself too little compassion and understanding. That’s something worth asking your Higher Power to remove.” In my head and heart, I did a Step Ten right there in the library. I also found a copy of the Big Book on the shelves and looked at what it had to say about that Step. On page 85 was a sentence I’d read many times before, but had never really thought much about. <em>We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. </em></p>\r\n<p>    I had gotten afraid—afraid that I was losing my sobriety because I’d felt a moment of temptation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	18	2024-02-08 02:07:15.903009	2024-02-08 02:10:18.724399

33	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>All of this may sound terribly cosmic or “woo-woo” to someone who hasn’t had a spiritual experience. But it’s not woo-woo at all. We realize—not just in our head, but in our body—that the Ripple Effect is as normal as breathing or walking or smiling.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Because of this realization, we’re naturally more calm, more loving, more serene, more willing to help, and more present than we used to be. Even people who think that the Ripple Effect is esoteric can’t help but notice the quality of our presence.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>To show you just how down-to-earth the Ripple Effect is, let’s look at our needs.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>When we practiced our addiction, whenever we felt a need, we demanded that other people meet it for us. We did this through dominance (such as bullying, manipulation, deal-making), dependence (such as people pleasing, flattery, playing the victim), or both.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Now, as Step Ten becomes a natural part of our life, we have grown out of this self-centered orientation. Instead, when a need arises in us, we examine it rather than spring into mindless action. Then we focus on meeting that need ourselves—either through our own actions, by asking for help from someone, or by asking for spiritual direction from our Higher Power.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>For instance, imagine that you want to find the right sponsor. You’re aware of the need, but you know that you can’t magically make that person appear. So instead, you go to lots of different meetings, where you’ll have the opportunity to meet many people. At each meeting, you keep an eye out for folks who might make a good sponsor. If someone impresses you in the right way, you introduce yourself to the person and talk for a bit. If this initial interaction feels right, you invite the person to have coffee or tea with you. But that’s not all you do. <em>You also ask your Higher Power for spiritual guidance.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>We keep in mind Steps Six and Seven and remember that it’s not always enough for us to do the right things; often we also have to ask for help, so that the things we can’t do on our own can come about.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>For example, in your search for a sponsor, you might have coffee at a café with Chris, whom you’ve seen a few times at meetings. It turns out that Chris is moving to New Zealand in three weeks, so she clearly can’t be your sponsor. But after a few minutes, Chris’s friend Sabrina comes into the café, spots her, and sits down next to you.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>As the three of you chat, you learn that Sabrina is also in a Twelve Step group and has three years of solid sobriety. You go to one of that group’s meetings and feel very much at home and like the kind of program that Sabrina is working. A month later you ask Sabrina if she will be your sponsor. She accepts.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>None of this would have happened if you hadn’t introduced yourself to Chris. That was your doing. But also, none of it would have happened if events entirely beyond your control—and your ability to plan—hadn’t taken place.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On the one hand, this sequence of events may seem perfectly ordinary. On the other, it is very much a spiritual experience:<em> a remarkable and unexpected turn for the better that turns out to be perfect for everybody involved.</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>We cannot control life. Often we cannot solve our own problems. But we can show up fully, ask the right questions, and open ourselves to unknown possibilities. When we do this, the universe may reveal to us a much better solution than we could have ever designed or imagined on our own.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	17	2024-02-01 00:20:26.362257	2024-02-01 00:26:52.493829

39	content	<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>People tell me </strong>I have every reason to be angry at my dad, because he molested me regularly for six years—from when I was seven until I was twelve.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I tell them, “No. I have every <em>right </em>to be angry. But I have a very good reason not to stay in anger and resentment.” Then I tell them the story I’m about to tell you.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I’m not going to give you the details of how he molested me. I’ll just say it’s not pretty. It happened dozens of times— whenever my mother was out of town. The details are mostly what you’d imagine—except that usually Dad was drunk or stoned.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The other pertinent detail is that my mom died of lung cancer when I was nineteen. She smoked two packs a day from the time she was a teenager, and she never slowed down until the last few months of her life.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The story I want to tell took place last summer, when I was forty-two. I hadn’t seen or spoken to my father for almost twenty years, when I ran into him unexpectedly.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I live in a small town in Missouri about fifty miles from where I grew up. I teach high school English. I like my job and I love having summers off.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I also love being clean and sober. From high school until five years ago, I put all kinds of shit into my body—meth, coke, crack, quaaludes, and lots and lots of alcohol—but never heroin, thank God. I’ll receive my five-year sobriety medallion next month.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Being clean and sober has meant not having to live in hell. I’m very grateful for that. But until about two years ago, I wasn’t very happy either. I’ve done plenty of therapy, and all kinds of healing strategies—EMDR, somatic therapy, massage, reiki, tai chi, yoga. They all helped me to come back to my body. But they didn’t help me with my anger and resentment. Those emotions kept living inside me like rats inside the walls of a house.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Early one morning last summer, I was rereading the story “Freedom from Bondage” in the Big Book. That really struck a nerve in me. In that story, a woman feels like she’s being eaten away by resentment toward her mother. I’d read it before—a couple of times—but this time a voice in my head said, That’s me.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I closed the book. That same voice said, <em>Enough. I’ve had enough. Dad already screwed up my life big time. I don’t want resentment and anger to screw it up more.<br></em><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I started crying—and I couldn’t stop. I must have cried for ten minutes straight.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;And you know what? After all those tears, afterward I was just as angry and resentful as before. That’s when I knew I couldn’t heal on my own. Even if I tried every type of therapy in the whole goddamn world.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I opened the Big Book again, to the Steps on page 59. I bowed my head and said aloud, “God, I have to have your help. Please take away my resentment and anger at Dad. I’ve kept him out of my life, but I can’t keep him out of my head.” And then I said something I hadn’t even consciously realized: “I don’t know if I can keep feeling this way without drinking or drugging again. Thy will be done.”</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt a little better after that, so I wiped my eyes and drove to a restaurant downtown that makes really good pancakes.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was sitting in a booth by the window, drinking coffee and waiting for my food, when a beat-up station wagon pulled up outside. The driver’s door opened and an old, obese man got out —very slowly. It looked like he had serious arthritis, or some other problem with moving. He kept trying to pull himself up out of the seat, without success.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought, <em>There’s someone who needs some help,</em> so I slid out of the booth and started to go outside to help him. And then, after a few steps, I realized—<em>it was my father. </em>Much older and much heavier, but definitely him. And what I felt for him right then was sadness. Just sadness. And a little twinge of pity.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;At that point, he managed to stand up, close the car door, and take a couple of steps. He didn’t look in my direction, and for a second I thought he was going to come into the restaurant. But he walked past the door and down the sidewalk. And then I lost sight of him.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I sat back down in the booth and said silently, <em>Thank you, Father.</em></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have some compassion for my father now. At times I still have flashes of anger or resentment toward him—but when I do, I immediately say a prayer: <em>God, please take this away.</em> And soon the feelings blow away.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I’m not interested in forgiving my father or reconciling with him. But I am interested in having a life—and I’m doing my best to have one, with the help of my Higher Power.</div>	Reading	20	2024-02-29 03:02:22.48811	2025-04-07 03:23:05.174134

41	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>   I’m a psychotherapist who has written some well-received selfhelp books. I give talks, lead workshops, and occasionally appear on radio or TV shows. I’m also an alcoholic with thirty-two years of recovery.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   In my AA group, of course, I’m just Arvette C. In some ways I’m not very anonymous, because I mention my addiction and recovery in my writing, and there aren’t a lot of Arvettes around. When new people show up to the group, some of them recognize me immediately.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   On the other hand, in some ways people <em>don’t</em> really recognize me. What they see is the respected elder and therapist and author with three decades of sobriety.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   What they fail to see is the flawed human being who is wired exactly like they are, and who is every bit as dependent on a Higher Power.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   My husband Don and I have been married for over forty years. He was a therapist, too, until he retired a few years ago. Our marriage is a good one, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have problems. People think therapists lead charmed lives, that we don’t struggle with the same crapola they do.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   Last March, Don and I were at the annual state AA roundup. I was one of the scheduled speakers. Don and I were having breakfast in the hotel restaurant about an hour before I was scheduled to speak. I noticed the people a couple of tables away —a pair of young men—looking at me. One of them pointed briefly at me and then spoke to his partner. I’m used to people occasionally recognizing me and pointing me out, so I just smiled at the couple and returned to eating and chatting with Don.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   Then, a minute later, one of the young men got up and came over. I assumed he wanted to thank me for my books, so I put on a big smile. When he got to the table, he leaned down close to me and whispered, “Ma’am, your dress is tucked into your underwear in back.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   My face must have turned the color of a tomato. I reached around and, sure enough, in back, the hem of my dress had gotten tucked into my panties. I stood up partway and fixed things as surreptitiously as I could. I thanked the young man, who said, “No problem,” and went back to his table.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   At that point I was totally flustered, totally off balance. I looked at Don, who had raised both his eyebrows.</p>\r\n<p>   I said to him in an angry whisper, “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>\r\n<p>   Don spread his hands. “I didn’t notice.”</p>\r\n<p>   “How could you not notice?” I said.</p>\r\n<p>   “How could <em>you </em>not notice?” Don asked.</p>\r\n<p>   I threw my napkin at him and said, “Screw you.”</p>\r\n<p>   Don’s eyes went wide. I hadn’t said anything like that to my husband in decades.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   Two words echoed in my head: <em>Step Ten</em>. I reached across the table and took his hand in mine. “Oh, my God,” I said. “Darling, I’m so sorry. So sorry. That was totally wrong of me. I was flustered and upset and embarrassed. I imagined the whole restaurant staring at my butt in my granny panties. What amends do you need me to make?”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   Don took a sip of coffee—one of his standard ways to buy time. He frowned and said in a very serious tone of voice, “Two things. Number one, next time you tell me to tuck in my shirt, I’m going to giggle, and you’re not going to say a thing. Number two, I want you relax and enjoy your breakfast, and then go and give an inspiring talk.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>   Let me tell you something. It doesn’t matter how long or solid your recovery is, or how completely you’ve turned your life over to a Higher Power. You’re still going to have problems: with your character flaws, especially as they surface with the significant people in your life, and sometimes with your clothing. There’s nothing in the Big Book that says all your problems will go away.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	21	2024-03-07 03:06:38.842138	2024-03-07 03:08:39.219399

Denial became a way of life—our way of dealing with problems.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    In recovery, many of us still fear problems. We may spend more time reacting to a problem than we do to solving it. We miss the point; we miss the lesson; we miss the gift. Problems are a part of life. So are solutions.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    A problem doesn’t mean life is negative or horrible. Having a problem doesn’t mean a person is deficient. All people have problems to work through.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    In recovery, we learn to focus on solving our problems. First, we make certain the problem is our problem. If it isn’t, our problem is establishing boundaries. Then we seek the best solution. This may mean setting a goal, asking for help, gathering more information, taking an action, or letting go.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Recovery does not mean immunity or exemption from problems; recovery means learning to face and solve problems, knowing they will appear regularly. We can trust our ability to solve problems, and know we’re not doing it alone. Having problems does not mean our Higher Power is picking on us. Some problems are part of life; others are ours to solve, and we’ll grow in necessary ways in the process.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Face and solve <em>today’s</em> problems. Don’t worry needlessly about tomorrow’s problems, because when they appear, we’ll have the resources necessary to solve them.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Facing and solving problems—working through problems with help from a Higher Power—means we’re living and growing and reaping benefits.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>God, help me face and solve my problems today. Help me do my part and let the rest go. I can learn to be a problemsolver.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h3><em>February 22</em></h3>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	33	2024-06-08 03:14:16.41252	2024-06-08 03:19:21.118686

45	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>    It’s been eight years since I stopped drinking and nine since my divorce. I’ve got a son, Dylan, who lives with my ex in Stockton, about 600 miles away. Dylan turned eleven last fall.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    I was a binge drinker. My addiction cost me my first career, and it was a big factor in my divorce from Meghan. I wasn’t a very good husband. Until I stopped drinking, I wasn’t much of a dad either.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    But Dylan was and is my son. And until recently, Meghan did everything she could to keep me away from him.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Our divorce was ugly. Meghan told her lawyer, “Bob is a no-good, useless drunk. The hell with him. I want the house; I want everything in it; I want whatever money we have left; and I want sole custody of Dylan forever.” The judge said yes to everything, and Meghan took Dylan 600 miles away.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    At that point, I had no wife and no son and no job and no house. That’s when I hit bottom and knew I had to either jump off a bridge or change my life. That’s also when I went to my first Twelve Step meeting.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    My first year of recovery was very rocky. But once I was back to work—I started fresh with selling cars, and now I’m the assistant manager of a large dealership—things began to improve steadily. I have plenty of regrets about how I used to be, but I’ve got a new life, a girlfriend I’m crazy about, and a great home group.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    But I still feel a big hole in my life. Dylan. We talk a couple of times a week, and I see him three or four times a year. It always means flying or driving to Stockton. I’ve tried to get Meghan to let him come to Boise, but she always says no.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Dylan was so young when we split up. He doesn’t really remember his old, drunk, messed-up dad. All he knows is this sober, loving guy who his mother says terrible things about. Part of him doesn’t understand why his mother talks such trash about me. Sometimes I have to remind him, “Your mother has every reason to resent the man she was married to. I don’t like that guy either.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    I did the necessary Step Nine work with Meghan. She was clear about what amends she needed, and I made them all. I’m still making them. I send her a generous amount of child support every month—more than the court requires. She’ll talk to me about Dylan when there’s something we need to discuss. Otherwise, she keeps her distance.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    The thing is, I want more time with my son. Meghan knows I’m a very different person from the man she married and divorced. But she absolutely refuses to let Dylan come out here. She says, “Ed, I can appreciate who you’ve become. But alcoholics sometimes relapse. If that ever happens with you, I don’t want Dylan to be there by himself, 600 miles from home.” I can’t really argue with that. But for a long time I resented it.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    The story I want to tell happened a couple of months ago. Dylan called me—which is unusual in itself. We usually talk at times we set up in advance. He was crying. He and Meghan had an old rescue dog, a collie they named Hercules. Hercules was dying, and they were going to have to put him down within the next few days. Dylan was very sad.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    We spent over half an hour talking about Hercules, who had been part of their family from the time they moved to Stockton. I asked him to tell me stories about his favorite times with Hercules. I let him talk, and mostly listened, and told him how sorry I was that he was losing a family member.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Dylan asked, “You don’t mind that I’m crying, do you?” and I said, “Of course not. People cry whenever those lose someone they love.” He nodded and said, “Mom’s crying too. She’s been great about Hercules, but she’s also sad. Mom, are you okay? Dad, I need to go now. Thanks for talking.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    After I hung up, I was filled with conflicting emotions. I was pleased to be able to connect with my son, and to be available when he needed me. But I was also a little angry that I couldn’t be there to comfort him in person. And I know this isn’t fair, but I also kind of resented poor Hercules, who’d been able to spend most of his life with Dylan. And I was angry at Meghan for keeping Dylan and me so far apart. Mostly, though, I felt sad for my son. He was far more important than my anger and resentment. Over the next few days, whenever those feelings bubbled up, I’d refocus my attention on Dylan and his grief.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    A week later, Dylan called again. He still sounded sad, but maybe a bit more thoughtful. He said, “We took Hercules to the vet yesterday and had him put to sleep. Not like sleep at night. The vet injected him with something that killed him and put him out of his misery.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    I asked him to tell me what had happened, and he told the story in detail. They had set Hercules on an examining table, and he and Meghan had held the dog while the vet gave the fatal injection. Hercules had licked Dylan’s hand just before the needle went in.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Dylan and I talked for almost an hour. I asked him if his mother would get another dog for the family, and he said, “I asked her that question too, and she said, ‘When we’re both ready.’”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Eventually he was talked out, and we got ready to say goodbye. Then he said, “When are you coming to visit? I miss you.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    After we hung up, I started crying.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    When I was done, I emailed Meghan. I thanked her for taking such good care of our son, and for being so loving and supportive with him during Hercules’ illness and death.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    An hour later, I got an email back from her. She’d cut and pasted my line about her being loving and supportive with Dylan. Underneath it she wrote, <em>Back at you. M</em>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    After that, my resentment toward Meghan was gone.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    I called my sponsor and said, “Roy, something really good just happened, but I can’t figure out exactly what.” I told him the story I just told you, and he said, “It sounds like you worked Step Ten without even realizing it.” I said, “Is that bad?” He said, “Hell, no. That’s the best way to work the Steps. It means they’re in your blood.”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	23	2024-03-28 01:31:50.520478	2024-03-28 01:36:03.735847

49	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>I drank and did coke for four years before my partner Andrea said, “That’s it. It’s either me or the drugs and the booze. You choose.” That’s when I went into treatment.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I was in an inpatient program in Arizona for almost four months. Our insurance only covered the first sixty days. Andrea wasn’t very happy about that.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The program was a good one. At first I tried all of my standard bullshit, and none of it worked on anyone. Which was a relief. It had worked on Andrea up until a few months before she laid down the law.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I went through the usual resistance and denial and withdrawal, and I completely fell apart. My counselors helped me through some dark days. At one point I was ready to kill myself, and they talked me down.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A few weeks into treatment, I started seriously working the Steps.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>By the time I went home and shifted into an aftercare program, I had worked the first eight Steps, and was well into making amends in Step Nine. I was feeling better than I’d felt in many years. My sanity had returned.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>So I get back, expecting a big welcome home, and maybe even a booze-and-drug-free party. But I get nothing of the sort. At the airport, Andrea gives me a peck on the cheek and says almost zip. When we get home, she lets me in, tells me she has errands to run, and takes off again.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>At first I figure that maybe she’s having a bad day, so I unpack, do some laundry, and make myself comfortable. I tell myself that things will get better.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>But they don’t. Andrea is distant and suspicious. She obviously doesn’t believe I’ve changed. She thinks I’m either faking it or that the changes won’t last, and any day I’ll turn into my old asshole drunk and coked-out self again.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>When I try to talk about it, she just says angrily, “Not now, okay?” or goes into the other room. As for sex, after four months of celibacy I’m more than ready but Andrea isn’t interested.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I mean, I get all this. She’s still angry at me for four years of bullshit. She’s entitled to her anger. But she’s also giving me zero credit for who I’ve become. It seems to me that she wants me to go back to drugging and drinking.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I talk to Tori, my aftercare counselor, about this. She says, “Jen, you can take the booze and the drugs out of a home, but you can’t take the history out of it. Andrea is probably very scared and very confused. You’re no longer the person she lived with for years. She adapted to your addiction and your unpredictability. Now that you’re sober, clean, sane, and predictable, she has no idea how to act around you. Because you’ve changed, she has to, too, if she’s going to be in relationship with you. It probably scares the hell out of her.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>So I say to Tori, “Here’s what I don’t understand. If I’d come back exactly the same person I was before treatment, Andrea would be angry and resentful because I wasn’t any better. But now, because I’m better, she’s angry and resentful.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Tori just laughs and says, “Welcome to recovery. Are you working Step Ten?”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>At this point I feel like working Step Ten 24/7. I’m trying hard to walk the line between responsibility and codependence. Every time I do anything wrong—forget an item at the grocery store, misplace my keys, leave the basement light on after I come back upstairs—I say to Andrea, “My bad, hon. I’ll make it right.” Usually she just shrugs and says, in a robot-like voice, “It doesn’t matter.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>So now I’m starting to get pretty pissed off too.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Finally, after about two weeks of being home, we’re sitting on the couch watching a movie—it was Moonstruck, with Cher and Nicolas Cage—and I reach over and take her hand. She quickly pulls it away. And then something opens up inside me.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I grab the remote, turn off the video, and stand up in front of her. I start to talk, in a voice I barely recognize—strong and calm and 100 percent serious. I have no idea what I’m even going to say. The words are just coming, without my thinking them.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I say, “Baby, for years I treated you like crap. I’ve told you that several times, but maybe I haven’t told you enough. For all those years I was a total self-centered jerk. I have no idea why you put up with me for as long as you did. You deserve much better.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“Now I’m trying as hard as I can to be the person you deserve. I’m working the Program day by day, going to meetings, and trying to be a decent human being. I’m going to screw up sometimes, but when I do, I’ll hold myself accountable and make amends. Maybe it’s already too late. Maybe I’ve hurt you too much, done too much damage. If that’s what’s going on, just tell me, and I’ll pack up and clear out.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Then I shut up. I just stand there, breathing hard. I’ve got no more words.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>For a couple of seconds, it’s like we’re both frozen in place. Then Andrea starts to sniffle. Then she leans over and starts to sob. Then she starts to howl, like a dying animal.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I’m standing there in shock. Andrea is bent over, tears pouring out of her eyes, making noises I’ve never heard a human being make before. Meanwhile, I’m thinking, It sounds like someone’s being murdered. The neighbors must have called the police by now.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Andrea falls on the floor, still howling. She starts shaking so hard that I wonder if she’s having a heart attack. That’s when the question forms in my head: How can I be of service right now?</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I get down on the floor beside her, wrap my arms around her from behind, and hold her hard and close for the next five minutes, while she cries and shakes and makes animal noises, until finally the pain has worked its way through her.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>And that’s what it took for things between us to begin to heal.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	25	2024-04-11 02:36:11.395497	2024-04-11 02:39:18.034201

Here are some phrases to help you quickly connect to the spiritual guidance of your Higher Power:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• I need your help or Please help me or just Help!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Please guide me or Tell me what to do.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Thy will be done or I’ll do whatever You say.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Thank you: a quick and easy way to remember to be grateful for whatever you have, even when there’s trouble.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2>When Someone Is Treating You Badly</h2>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>No life is free of conflicts. As we work the Program, we try as much as possible to resolve conflicts through listening, loving and mindful discussion, compromise, or a blend of these.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Inevitably, though, conflicts with some people will persist or seem unresolvable. Here are some helpful practices for navigating them:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Show the other person the same tolerance, pity, and patience you would cheerfully grant a sick friend. If you have trouble doing this on your own, ask your Higher Power for help. (You’ll recognize this practice from page 67 of the Big Book.)</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Ask yourself, How can I be most helpful to this person? If necessary, ask your Higher Power the same question. Once you know the answer, act on it.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• If a harmful emotion or impulse bubbles up inside you, ask your Higher Power to remove it. This is the purest, simplest form of using Step Ten to work Step Seven.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• If you’re about to say something you know you’ll regret, physically intervene on yourself. Literally bite your tongue. Or inhale and exhale quickly instead of speaking. Repeat as necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Follow Emmet Fox’s advice and focus on God. Imagine the other person as a manifestation of the Divine All. Or picture that person bathed in love and Divine light. Or hold in your heart that person’s pure spiritual nature. Or simply beam love in that direction. It may also help to simply ignore what the person is saying.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• Follow the lead of the recovering addict who wrote “Freedom from Bondage” in the Big Book (pages 544–553). Think of all the good things you would like for yourself. Then wish—or pray—that the person you’re in conflict with would get all of those good things. Do this repeatedly, if necessary.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• If things keep getting worse, quickly remove yourself from the situation. Say, “Could you hold that thought? I need to step away briefly and take five.” Or “I’m not at my best right now; let me take a minute to collect myself . . . I’ll be right back.” Then leave. Take a few minutes to mentally review what just occurred and do a quick inventory, say one of the slogans or the Serenity Prayer, or do a quick Step Ten if you need to, and then return. If it’s clear that further interactions with the person won’t help, go back and say, “I don’t think we’re getting anywhere; I need to go and maybe we can pick this up another time when we’re both in a better place.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• When all else fails, end the conversation. Say “I need for us to just end this and move on” or “Let’s just agree to disagree.” Then walk away. This doesn’t solve the conflict, but it usually keeps things from unraveling further.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	24	2024-04-04 03:18:59.287977	2024-04-04 03:21:08.463311

51	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>A variety of Step Ten inventory sheets are available for recovering people to fill out at the end of each day. These ask questions such as How was I selfish? How was I resentful? How was I dishonest? How did I demand control? Who did I hurt and how? Did I keep any secrets? What could I have done better? and so on. (For samples, type “Step Ten inventory” into your search engine.)</p>\r\n<p>These inventories can be very helpful, especially for people just beginning to work Step Ten. But this programmed approach can also limit how people view the Step.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some other options for making the most of predesigned inventories:</p>\r\n<p>• Add some personalized questions and create your own process for working with them. For example, if one of your character defects is excessive self-sacrifice, you might add to your inventory How many times today did I say “I’m sorry?” If you tend to dominate conversations, add the question How many times today did I interrupt people? If you’re quick to focus on self-interest, add the question How many times today did I ask myself, “What’s in it for me?”</p>\r\n<p>• Each morning, review your inventory questions—not as a review of your own past actions, but as a way to help ground and orient you for the day. Then mentally walk through the day to come, reviewing your goals, hopes, and plans. Note any potential trouble spots and reflect on how you plan to handle them.</p>\r\n<p>• Post your inventory in a prominent place in your kitchen, or above your desk, or as your screen saver. Each day, simply review it for thirty to sixty seconds. Let the questions sink deeply into you, day by day, until they become a part of you.</p>\r\n<p>As you continue to grow into the Steps—and as they take deeper root in you—even the words every day will take on new meaning. You will move from working Step Ten daily, to working it whenever it can be helpful, to living the Steps at all times. Eventually, living the Twelve Steps will become as natural and automatic as breathing—something you do not just every day, or day by day, but moment by moment, in every moment. Your life will then no longer be your life, but a life shared with others. It will be an ongoing, ever-unfolding spiritual experience.</p>\r\n</div>	Reading	26	2024-04-18 03:59:00.105694	2024-04-18 04:04:31.336356

Sure enough, a sliver of beach has appeared.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Slowly the boat approaches the shore. Soon the friends can make out trees and a dock, and, just beyond it, what looks like a waiting passenger train. The ship blows its horn, and a moment later a voice booms out over the loudspeakers.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We’re now approaching Serenity Island. In a moment I’ll cut the engines and we’ll begin the last part of our approach. I’ll join all of you on deck shortly.” A few seconds later, the boats engines stop throbbing. Gradually the boat slows until, after a few minutes, it is barely moving.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The captain—a smiling, elderly woman in a white uniform—climbs down from the wheelhouse and begins greeting passengers. As she shakes hands with Mary and Ramon, Ramon asks, “Why aren’t we moving? We’re still a good quarter mile from shore.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The captain nods. “This is as close as the boat can sail. From here to the shore, the water is very shallow.” She gestures to a shed on the deck behind her. “In a moment my crew will hand out life rings. You’ll need to swim the rest of the way.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“Swim?” Ramon asks. “I didn’t expect I’d have to swim. It’s been a long day and I’m tired.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The captain raises her eyebrows but maintains her smile. “Recovery is a journey, but it’s not a pleasure cruise. Once you’re on board, there’s guidance and momentum, but you can’t just kick back and become complacent.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“But I can’t swim!” the young man next to Ramon says. The captain nods again. “That’s why we have life rings. Each of you will put one on, and you’ll help each other get to shore.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Mary points toward the beach. “Where does the train go?” she asks the captain. “I can’t quite make out its destination sign from here. Wait . . . there’s an R. It says . . . it says, Recovery.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“That’s right,” the captain says. “The journey of recovery never ends— but over time the geography changes. So sometimes the journey is by water, sometimes by land. And sometimes even by air.” She points up at the sky above the island. Rising slowly into it, in the far distance, is a brightly colored passenger balloon with a large R painted on the side. In the basket beneath it, just barely visible, is a group of waving people.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“Do you think they’re waving at us?” Mary asks.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>“Of course,” Ramon says. “And I’ll bet they’re shouting, ‘Hey, friends!

This engine creates an ongoing feedback loop of internal ripples that looks like this:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>• The condition of my character shapes my thinking.</p>\r\n<p>• The condition of my thinking shapes my decisions.</p>\r\n<p>• The condition of my decisions shapes my actions.</p>\r\n<p>• The condition of my actions shapes my practices and habits.</p>\r\n<p>• The condition of my practices and habits shapes my character.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    As we work Step Ten, we steadily strengthen our ability to observe all aspects of this internal process. This helps us make conscious and loving choices, rather than impulsive or fearful ones.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    The people who founded Alcoholics Anonymous didn’t think in terms of this engine, but they were keenly aware of its elements. Steps One and Two cover our thinking. Step Three covers our decisions. Steps Four through Nine cover our actions. Steps Ten and Eleven cover our practices and habits. And Step Twelve covers our character. Twelve Step Programs offer healing and transformation at every point in this loop.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Other programs for addressing addiction intervene at specific spots in the loop, but not throughout the entire loop. For example, rational behavioral therapy intervenes at the points of thinking and action. Reality therapy intervenes at the point of action. These and other helpful interventions help people stay out of trouble in the short term and change their behavior for the better. But they’re not spiritual programs that lead to transformed lives.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>	Reading	28	2024-05-09 03:29:21.227414	2024-05-09 03:30:35.662108

We notice their posture and the flow of their gestures. We hear the cadences and tone of their voice. We see the look in their eyes and the way they make (or avoid) eye contact.

Part of me wants to get defensive myself and say something snarky. But that will do neither of us any good. I wonder if something else is going on.

63	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>An editor of The Grapevine called on me and asked me for a piece. He asked because I recently reviewed a book about a drunk – Charles Jackson’s The Lost Weekend. He thought that what I’d said in the review showed I had an interest in alcoholism. I have. The editor didn’t know that I am one.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I quit solo – by which I mean that no organized group like AA was around to assist or advise. But I had plenty of assistance and expert advice, much of which curiously parallels what I know now about AA. To reach a point where I can say that I am not drinking and have not been drinking for a long time, took years. It took an unconscionable amount of energy. It left me with a few ideas that I’d like to pass along. It left me with a couple of hunches that I’d like to ask about.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The things I did are, maybe, the things that others are doing. I was psychoanalyzed twice. I studied psychology after that – Jungian, Freudian, Alderian, behavioristic. Then I read all the basic religious books. Then I read the philosophies. Then I went to insane asylums and looked at them.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Here are some of the ideas that came my way:<br>One of the “reasons” I had given myself for drinking was that I was then able to do easily a great many things other men could do sober and I could not. So I did them sober. I did everything without a drink that I had done when drunk, excepting for the destructive trouble making ones. Everything. That was useful to me.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I had jitters that there is not the literary skill to describe – though Charles Jackson has come as close as any writer ever did. Every fear, phobia and compulsion entered my head – and not so always just when I was hung over. So I got into the habit – a suggestion of a psychiatrist – of writing down in detail the nature and formidability of these mental distresses. Maybe the fact that I am a writer gave that system special merit. But I found I couldn’t endlessly retail the awfulness of my obsessions – sitting perfectly comfortably in a quiet room. On paper – they weren’t gigantic and overwhelming. They grew silly. They made me laugh at myself and do deflated themselves.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Dr. Jung himself suggested that I look at a few asylums. I don’t know why until I made the visit. Then it became evident to me that the inmates were not like me at all. Thus I got to know that my alcoholism was not the onslaught of insanity – and I got to know I had been subconsciously afraid of precisely that.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The Jungians, incidentally, give a different name to the “religious experience” which you discuss in AA. They arrive at that “experience” by different methods – methods which conform to their scientific psychological technique. They call the spiritual quantum which gives rise to the experience a “transcendent symbol.” Naturally, I haven’t room to describe the method here: it would take more than this magazine – a book perhaps. But, whether you call it a religious experience or a transcendant symbol does not matter – and it may be of interest to alcoholics who are semi-knowingly engaged in protesting formal, churchly “religions” to learn that there are thoroughly abstract, non-religious routes to the same, universal, human contact with inner integrity, truth, and the “nature of nature itself.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Of course, I read everything about alcoholism I could find. And I became interested in the care and condition of alcoholic friends. Among them I noticed two who still make me wonder about the possible relationship of epilepsy to alcoholism in some cases. These two friends of mine had had fits. They both had the epileptic “picture” on the electroencephalogram. The new drugs that avert or postpone epileptic attacks seemed to aid these two men in stopping their alcohol addiction. I know that if I were a doctor – and an alcoholic – I’d investigate this special aspect of the puzzle thoroughly. The possible future values of chemistry should not be overlooked by any of us in the presence of the proved value of psychological and philosophical regeneration.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I also have a hunch that insanities, neuroses, and all other aberrations vary largely with the passing of centuries. Alcoholism too. I do not believe people in the main were exactly the same sort alcoholics and for the same reason in 1700 as in 1944. That is to say, I believe such conditions of the soul are “as if” epidemic – and definitely of a social causation. That is what especially interests me about AA: it represents to me the first really effective effort to deal in kind and in scale and in the right category, with alcoholism.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	32	2024-06-06 03:46:10.670204	2024-06-06 03:49:13.4273

Bill’s reply follows. </em></div>\r\n<div class="trix-content"><em><br></em>\r\n<p>    Philip Wylie’s piece in this issue of the Grapevine will endear the man to every AA. And why? Because, of course, he’s so very alcoholic! Neither can anyone miss the author’s generous and self-sacrificing spirit. Forgetting his own worldly importance, he snaps his fingers at what the public may think; he discards his <em>reputation </em>in order to share with us his <em>character</em>. A traveler who has felt his own way out of the night, he tells how he discovers haven. We could ask no better spirit of anyone. Mr. Wylie can be a member of AA the very day he says so!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    It is tradition among us that the individual has the unlimited right to his own opinion on any subject under the sun. He is compelled to agree with no one; if he likes, he can disagree with everyone. And indeed, when on a “dry bender,” many AAs do. Therefore, no AA should be disturbed if he cannot fully agree with all of Mr. Wylie’s truly stimulating discourse. Rather shall we reflect that the roads to recovery are many; that any story or theory of recovery from one who has trod the highway is bound to contain much truth. Mr. Wylie’s article is like an abundance of fresh fruit. Perhaps we should take the advice of the housewife who says, “We shall eat all we can, and then can what we can’t.”</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    What caught my attention most was his reference to the spiritual experience, “a la Jung,” seemingly induced “by scientific psychological technique.” What a boon that would be to us who wrestle every day with the agnostic newcomer. If only we could give him a straight dose of that “transcendent symbol” and have it over with! We wouldn’t have to bother with that tedious business of waiting while our prospect batters himself into sufficient open-mindedness to accept the possibility of a Power greater than himself.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    But, as Mr. Wylie broad-mindedly observes, it doesn’t matter too much how the transforming spiritual experience is brought about so long as one gets one that works for him. Somehow the alcoholic must get enough objectivity about himself to abate his fears and collapse his false pride. If he can do all this through his intellect, and thereafter support his life structure upon a “transcendent symbol,” more power to him! Most AAs, however, would think this design for living pretty inadequate. They would consider downright humility and faith in the power of the living God a much stronger medicine. AA draws frankly upon emotion and faith, while the scientific intellectual would avoid these resources as much as he can. Yet the more intellectual techniques do work sometimes, reaching those who might never be able to take the stronger dose. Besides, they remind us, when overly proud of our own accomplishment, that AA has no monopoly on reviving alcoholics.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    In fact, it is already evident that the scientific world is becoming more appreciative of our methods than we are of theirs. In this respect they are commencing to teach <em>us </em>humility.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Listen again, as our friend Dr. Harry Tiebout, psychiatrist, closes his paper “Basic Techniques of Alcoholics Anonymous,” before the American Psychiatric Association: “The lesson for psychiatrists is clear, it seems to me. Although we admittedly deal with emotional problems, we, as a group which tends to be intellectual, distrust emotions too much. We are selfconscious and a little ashamed when we are forced to use them, and always apologetic with our confreres if we suspect they have reason to think our methods are too emotional. In the meantime, others, less bound by tradition, go ahead to get results denied to us. It is highly imperative for us as presumably open-minded scientists to view wisely and long the efforts of others in our field of work. We may be wearing bigger blinders than we know.” And again, as he says, “A religious, or spiritual experience, is <em>the act of giving up reliance on one’s own omnipotence.“</em></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    As we AAs are people who are supposed to have given up all our own “omnipotence,” I'm sure that Mr. Wylie will be read with the attentive interest he deserves!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	34	2024-06-13 01:15:24.181206	2024-06-13 01:34:00.982794

Go ahead. Get it all out. Once we begin recovery, we may feel like it’s not okay to gripe and complain. We may tell ourselves that if we were really working a good program, we wouldn’t need to complain.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    What does that mean? We won’t have feelings? We won’t feel overwhelmed? We won’t need to blow off steam or work through some not-so-pleasant, not-so-perfect, and not-so-pretty parts of life?</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    We can let ourselves get our feelings out, take risks, and be vulnerable with others. We don’t have to be all put together, all the time. That sounds more like codependency than recovery.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Getting it all out doesn’t mean we need to be victims. It doesn’t mean we need to revel in our misery, finding status in our martyrdom. It doesn’t mean we won’t go on to set boundaries. It doesn’t mean we won’t take care of ourselves.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Sometimes, getting it all out is an essential part of taking care of ourselves. We reach a point of surrender so we can move forward.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    Self-disclosure does not mean only quietly reporting our feelings. It means we occasionally take the risk to share our human side—the side with fears, sadness, hurt, rage, unreasonable anger, weariness, or lack of faith.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>    We can let our humanity show. In the process, we give others permission to be human too. “Together” people have their not-so-together moments. Sometimes, falling apart—getting it all out—is how we get put back together.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h3>    <em>Today, I will let it all out if I need a release.</em></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	35	2024-07-18 03:54:23.781025	2024-07-18 03:55:54.72722

75	content	<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<div class="trix-content">\r\n<p>I’ve been recovering many years. I’ve used denial many times. It has been a defense, a survival device, a coping behavior, and, at times, almost my undoing. It has been both a friend and an enemy. When I was a child, I used denial to protect myself and my family. I protected myself from seeing things too painful to see and feelings too overwhelming to feel. Denial got me safely through many traumatic situations, when I had no other resources for survival. The negative aspect of using denial was that I lost touch with myself and my feelings. I became able to participate in harmful situations without even knowing I was hurting. I was able to tolerate a great deal of pain and abuse without the foggiest notion it was abnormal.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I learned to participate in my own abuse. Denial protected me from pain, but it also rendered me blind to my feelings, my needs, and myself. It was like a thick blanket that covered and smothered me.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Eventually I began to recover. I had a glimpse of awareness about my pain, my feelings, my behaviors. I began to see myself, and the world, as we were. There was so much denial from my past that had the blanket been entirely ripped from me, I would have died from the shock of exposure. I needed to embrace insights, remembrances, awareness, and healing gently, gradually.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Life participated in this process with me. It is a gentle teacher. As I recovered, I was brought to the incidents and people I needed in order to remind me of what I was still denying, to tell me where I required more healing from my past, as I could handle these insights.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I still use, and break through, denial—as needed. When the winds of change blow through, upsetting a familiar structure and preparing me for the new, I pick up my blanket and hide, for a while. Sometimes, when someone I love has a problem, I hide under the blanket, momentarily. Memories emerge of things denied, memories that need to be remembered, felt, and accepted so I can continue to become healed—strong and healthy.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, I feel ashamed about how long it takes me to struggle through to acceptance of reality. I feel embarrassed when I find myself again clouded by the fog of denial. Then something happens, and I see that I am moving forward. The experience was necessary, connected, not at all a mistake, but an important part of healing.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>It’s an exciting process, this journey called recovery, but I understand I may sometimes use denial to help me get through the rough spots. I’m also aware that denial is a friend, and an enemy. I’m on the alert for danger signs: those cloudy, confused feelings . . . sluggish energy . . . feeling compulsive . . . running too fast or hard . . . avoiding support mechanisms.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I’ve gained a healthy respect for our need to use denial as a blanket to wrap ourselves in when we become too cold. It isn’t my job to run around ripping people’s blankets off or shaming others for using the blanket. Shaming makes them colder, makes them wrap themselves more tightly in the blanket. Yanking their blanket away is dangerous. They could die of exposure, the same way I could have.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I’ve learned the best thing I can do around people who are wrapped in this blanket is to make them feel warm and safe. The warmer and safer they feel, the more able they are to drop their blanket. I don’t have to support or encourage their denial. I can be direct. If others are in denial about a particular thing, and their activity is harmful to me, I don’t have to be around them. I can wish them well and take care of myself. You see, if I stand too long around someone who is harming me, I will inevitably pick up my blanket again.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I tend to be attracted to warm people. When I’m around warm people, I don’t need to use my blanket.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>I’ve gained respect for creating warm environments, where blankets are not needed, or at least not needed for long. I’ve gained trust in the way people heal from and deal with life. God, help me be open to and trust the process that is healing me from all I have denied from my past. Help me strive for awareness and acceptance, but also help me practice gentleness and compassion for myself—and others— for those times I have used denial.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>	Reading	38	2024-08-29 03:53:48.739215	2024-08-29 04:06:14.703716

91	content	<div>It was late one night. I was sitting home on the edge of my bed and into my room flew a red macaw that landed on my shoulder. “You shot the sheriff,” it squawked in my ear. “You shot the sheriff!” As soon as it came, it flew away. But I knew the cops were after me and told my therapist that the next day. The next thing you know, I was being carted off to the psych ward for the tenth time in my three and a half years sober, due to my schizophrenia and bipolar illness.<br><br>I was 24 when I came into AA. I remember reading the Second Step and immediately thinking that AA could cure my mental illness. I was off my meds for 26 days before I was brought to the hospital by an ambulance that my sponsor had called. It took me a year or two before I figured out that I had to stay on my meds in order for them to work.<br><br>When I was early in sobriety, I went to a meeting a day, sometimes two or three. As I was sobering up and my mental health deteriorated, I realized I needed to take care of my mental health in addition to my alcoholism. Now I go to one AA meeting a week, one MICD (mental illness chemical dependency) group, see a therapist and a psychiatrist on a regular basis, attend two support groups for my mental health and meet with my sponsor once a week. This formula has worked for me to balance my alcoholism and mental illness.<br><br>When I first got sober, I dove into the whole spirituality thing. I would pray all the time, read books, go to church. I thought I had reached the pinnacle of spirituality; I could hear God’s voice. He talked to me and I talked back. There is no way to describe the elation experienced with undiagnosed psychotic mania. Then, one day, I was talking to God and he told me to kill myself. Thank God I had the wherewithal to run to my sponsor and she told me to go to the hospital immediately. The next two years of my life were spent in and out of the hospital, in and out of reality. But I stayed sober.<br><br>In “How It Works,” it states: “There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.” If I were to be honest with myself, I frequently did not have the capacity to be honest, due to my mental illness. My sponsor at the time and I would frequently joke, “I don’t need a Power greater than myself; I need a Power saner than myself!” So I used those around me to keep me safe and sober until I could have the capacity to be honest back.<br><br>In looking at what I’ve been through so far in my sobriety, I have every reason to be discontented. I lost my job due to my mental illness and I am living on disability with my family. But I am content. I trust my Higher Power has a plan for me. I used to measure my happiness by my success, but now I don’t need anything to bring me happiness. AA has taught me to accept what life throws at me, and so—at any moment, no matter what’s going on in my life—my happiness comes from within.</div>	Reading	46	2024-10-21 02:40:44.828358	2024-10-21 02:40:44.828358

93	content	<div>I first came to AA at the age of 18. I had been drinking alcoholically since I was 13 and my teenage years were filled with problems—legal trouble, being expelled from school, my mom kicking me out of the house at age 17. Even at that age I was already akin to the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde mentioned in the Big Book. I, too, was never “mildly intoxicated” but  always “insanely drunk.”<br><br>Within eight months of getting my driver’s license I already had two DUI’s. I asked mom to help me out and she got me into a treatment center through her employer’s insurance plan. I went to a 28-day program and then a long term seven month program and when I got out I was already on Steps Eight and Nine. I began going to meetings daily, got a sponsor, got involved in service work, began sponsoring other young men and as a result I stayed sober for four years. But when I had four years and three months, my mother passed away from a brain aneurism at the young age of 46 and I began going to fewer meetings, stopped doing service work and working with other alcoholics and before my fourth year was up I relapsed.<br><br></div><div> It didn’t take long before I was back drinking just as bad as I did at age 18. I soon received my third DUI, lost my driver’s license,  completed a couple of 28 day programs but just couldn’t keep from returning to that first drink. So began my attempts at geographical cures. Over a two year period, I moved to four different states via Greyhound bus and finally landed in Texas, where my consequences became more serious. I committed two felonies, had my probations revoked, and spent 27 months in prison. <br><br></div><div>When I got out I was dead serious about staying sober, but I failed to enlarge my spiritual life and soon after my release I had talked myself into that first drink—again. The next years were filled with many attempts at regaining my sobriety with many returns to the first drink. I had also gotten addicted to a few other hardcore substances throughout the years and at the age of 50, I found myself in a men’s recovery house in a new city a thousand miles away from Texas. I was there for ten days, got drunk and got kicked out. I found myself at a homeless shelter downtown, completely bankrupt, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually.<br><br></div><div> Hope was now officially gone. How could there possibly be hope for a guy like me?<br><br></div><div>I had been going to a lot of meetings while at this recovery center and I so badly wanted to want sobriety. I asked God to please do with me what he would and take this insanity away from me. A gentleman in a suit came and spoke to us in the dining hall that night. From the podium, he said the words that would change my life: “Just one year ago I was sitting in that folding chair just like you, staring at the floor just like you, thinking there was no hope for me, just like you, and I asked God to take over from here and said I will do whatever you need me to do.” <br><br></div><div>I got it—I finally got it. At last, I surrendered and understood that I was powerless over alcohol and that without God’s help there was no hope. I was sleeping on a mattress on a floor with a hundred other men sleeping on the same floor but I was at peace inside. I knew I was done and I knew that I was willing to do whatever was required to not return to that first drink. It has now been almost nine years and I have not returned to the insanity of that first drink. All that is required is that I follow a few simple rules. Trust God, Clean House, Help Others!<br><br></div><div>I got my driver’s license back after 27 years of not having one. I have zero legal issues. I have a loving beautiful wife and a life that I could never have imagined possible. <br><br></div><div>My mom passed away when I had four years three months sober and I relapsed. And my father also passed away when I had another four years three months sober, but this time I stayed sober. I was able to be there for my father and to be the son he needed me to be all because of a loving God who reached into the mire and lifted me out when I was ready and because of the program of Alcoholics Anonymous.  <br><br></div><div>You do not need to relapse to get this thing. Daily reprieve based on the maintenance of my spiritual condition is what changed my life. It is that simple—one day at a time.<br><br></div>	Reading	47	2024-10-28 03:55:58.060015	2024-11-08 04:12:24.971837

99	content	<pre><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong> This reading discusses sensitive topics, including \r\nsuicide, grief, trauma, and struggles with mental health. \r\nIf these themes are difficult for you, please take care of yourself\r\nas needed, and know that support is available within the fellowship.</pre><div><br>It was December of 2018. I had called the police multiple times. After that last call, when she wouldn’t answer her phone, I had an ominous feeling. <br><br></div><div>“I’ve got a bad feeling,” I texted my friends. Then I waited alone in that uncomfortable dread for a phone call back from the police. When the officer did call me back, it was not good news. She was dead. There was a gun and it was fatal. There can be no worse feeling, except for the call to her family to tell them the tragic news.<br><br></div><div>I don’t know why I continue to suffer from the delusion that because I’m sober, years sober, that I have somehow developed superhuman capabilities, so the pain of this world doesn’t affect me. I’m acutely aware today just how fragile I am, and I’m consciously working on attempting to tell myself it’s OK that I hurt. I know this because when my beautiful friend died by suicide in December, I was forever changed.<br><br></div><div>She was like so many of the alcoholics we meet, struggling with staying sober, in and out of rehabs, detoxes, ERs and hospitals. I had known her for six years. I had sponsored her, been her friend and loved her like my own child. And it wasn’t like she didn’t try. She would do anything I suggested, get in the car, get on a plane, do what we do. But the disease always overtook her.<br><br></div><div>This may seem like an outside issue, but I believe I’m not alone, and it deeply affects us in the rooms. No one talks about the vicarious trauma that can occur with working with others in the program. So, here are a few facts. Nearly 90% of all suicides that occur are associated with a diagnosable mental health or substance-abuse disorder. The likelihood of suicide in diagnosed alcoholics is between 60 and 120 times that of the non-psychiatrically ill individual. That’s high, extremely high. My friend was not my first AA friend to die from suicide, but she was my closest loss. And I know I’m not the only one touched by this loss in AA. Do we talk about it in any of our literature? Do we often treat our emotional sobriety as an outside issue?<br><br></div><div>What are the common themes among those who attempt suicide? Feelings of hopelessness, despair, isolation. Sound familiar? I know I have felt the same feelings in the last 10 months since her death, isolated by my feelings of loss, hopeless to be able to save someone’s life. I’m fortunate. I have been surrounded by loving members of the Fellowship, and I’m eternally grateful for that support. Yet my pain remains. Being in the middle of this Fellowship means feeling joy like we’ve never felt it, but possibly pain and loss as well.<br><br></div><div>Based on the statistics, we alcoholics have a higher likelihood that we will be exposed to this pain and tragedy at some point. Can we find compassion and empathy for those who have experienced this? Can we not make callous remarks, such as, “So and so went back out so we don’t have to,” or, “They died so we can live.” Many people don’t realize the additional pain they can cause with these remarks. <br><br></div><div>I don’t have all the answers. I’m just profoundly aware that this topic affects many of us. I wish we could find a way to help each other more. I know today to reach out to those who listen and will give me the space to grieve. I don’t judge myself for feeling sad. And I share my pain. I know it’s difficult sometimes in an AA meeting filled with laughter and humor to share that which is not funny or happy, but this is where I am today. Recovery has taught me the only way through something is through it. To thine own self be true.<br><br><br></div>	Reading	50	2024-11-11 03:10:14.113413	2024-11-11 03:11:50.079107

105	content	<div>Whenever I minimize people to a black-and-white comment (What a jerk! What a saint! What a knockout!), I turn the polychromatic into the monochromatic and confuse the snapshot with the big picture. I must remind myself that we are far too colorful to be captured like this, even when doing so makes people easier to accept or dismiss. I also need to refrain from applying this thinking back on myself: At any given time, I am a jerk, a saint, and—having never been a knockout—fat, bald and repulsive. Or so I would have me believe.<br><br></div><div>Who among us alcoholics belongs on a pedestal? Today, I know that whenever I get up on my high horse, the horse takes on a second ass. I also know that soapboxes get more slippery with more height. What’s more difficult for me to accept is that everyone has the right to mount their own high horses and soap boxes. I should not take guilty pleasure in their fall or become indignant when they don’t.<br><br></div><div>We must always keep a “backstage view” of ourselves, acknowledging the audience, yet aware that we are all actors. Honest sharing, warts and all, allows others to peek behind our curtains.<br><br></div><div>When I was drinking, I would stand in front of hundreds of people, waxing wise, knowing full well that I was as high as a kite. I was jaywalking! Pursuing that little thrill of “gettingaway with it.” A few friends knew me well enough to know the truth, but the rest were being duped, or so I thought, until I was clipped and - finally smashed at for all the world to see. Today, when I jaywalk in a meeting or two, my friends pull my covers and keep me honest.<br><br></div><div>It’s painfully obvious when a polished outside job is devoid of a sincere inside job. Yet, when people compliment me on some virtuous behavior, rather than feel guilty that I’m not all that virtuous, I’m thankful that some small part of me is exactly that person. Some of us have spent so many years beating ourselves up that we confuse a pat on the back for another whipping. We’re all God’s children.<br><br></div><div>Thank you for giving me the benefit of the doubt, even after I removed all doubt as to who I was. Thank you for inviting me to keep coming back, knowing that unfamiliar good behavior repetitively applied would eventually replace familiar poor behavior.

107	content	<div>For travel reasons, my family decided to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday one week early this year. In addition to our large extended family, many friends were invited to join, and we ended up with a total of 46 people, 15 of whom were children under the age of 14.<br><br></div><div>Besides the children, I was the only one at the celebration who doesn’t drink. My family gatherings seem to contain only normal drinkers—people who I would not consider to be alcoholic. Nobody gets sloppy drunk, violent, verbally abusive, angry or overly emotional. Most of the time when I’m at a family gathering, I don’t even notice that people are drinking alcohol.<br><br></div><div>There is always a very well- stocked bar at holiday celebrations, including fancy alcohols and some very tasty-sounding concoctions that I never heard of because I got sober before they went on the market.<br><br></div><div>I never liked the taste of alcohol. I drank strictly for the effect, not the taste. So I always preferred the “foo foo” drinks or the flavored alcohols if I was in a position to get them. Of course, at the end of my drinking, most of the time I would drink whatever I could get my hands on regardless of how it tasted. I wanted—no, I needed—that effect that came at once from taking a few drinks.<br><br></div><div>Frequently during the family holidays, no doubt because I’m a little excluded from the focus on drinking, I tend to find myself feeling different, a little more of an outsider, a little more “not-part-of.” I know these feelings originate within me and have nothing to do with the way my family treats me. I know they all love me, and they treat me with love, respect and kindness.<br><br></div><div> This year I had already helped with setting up the buffet, tables and chairs, place settings and the usual stuff. But once that was done, we had to wait another couple of hours for the food to finish cooking. This is the time everyone looks forward to, when they can relax, have their before-dinner drinks, talk and laugh.<br><br></div><div>I was nursing a glass of water, and feeling like an outsider, feeling useless and beginning to get into self-pity. Why can’t I drink like everyone else? It’s not fair! I thought. I then noticed that the smaller children were bored and running around the house crying, fussing and arguing with each other. They were not having fun at all. Neither was I! I was instantly annoyed that the parents weren’t paying attention to disciplining (insert complaint here) their children at this gathering. Oh no! I could feel myself becoming irritable, restless and discontent! I knew I’d better do something quick. I decided to be of service by keeping the kids occupied.<br><br></div><div>So I got out of my chair, rounded up all the kids, took them outside in the backyard and organized them into playing as many of the old childhood games as I could remember. We played Hide and Seek, Red Light Green Light, Mother May I, Red Rover and Duck Duck Goose. As time went by, some of the teenagers came out and joined in. There was more laughing and fun going on outside than there was inside. The kids were having a ball, and I think I was having more fun than they were! I didn’t even notice how fast the time passed. Before we knew it, it was time for dinner. Because the kids had burned so much energy, they were all (almost) perfect angels during dinner. Not only did I have a blast keeping the kids happy and occupied, but that feeling of uselessness and self-pity had disappeared. I had lost interest in selfish things and gained interest in my fellows.<br><br></div><div>I had such a great time this year.maybe I will make playing with the kids part of my normal holiday routine from now on!<br><br></div>	Reading	54	2024-11-28 01:02:16.750412	2024-11-28 01:02:16.750412

109	content	<div>It was a 7:00 A.M. meeting. I couldn’t believe that the people, who I didn’t even know, were all laughing and drinking coffee. But I thought they were laughing at me.<br><br>I knew I needed help to stop drinking. I tried and tried to stop on my own so many times and I could not stop. I just couldn’t do it. I was wondering how this group of people could help. And now I felt like they were laughing at me<br><br>I had pulled my car into the church parking lot earlier looking for the meeting. I saw the other cars but didn’t know exactly where the meeting was. Finally, as luck would have it—or bad luck would have it—this very tall lady saw me and told me to follow her. I was ready to make a run for it, but she kind of herded me toward the right door. She never touched me, but I felt like her long crossed arms wouldn’t let me run. I (we) got to the door, and I was in.<br><br>My idea of running away was still the most likely thing I could think of to do, but I was too polite to run. The first thing I saw was a guy with a bomb tattooed on his upper arm. You know, the cartoon kind of bomb, black and round with a fuse. When I checked out the people in the front row, they all wore long-sleeved shirts. I knew their tattoo bombs were under there. I knew this was a cult, only they didn’t tell me the password to get in—and they didn’t tell me I needed to have a bomb tattoo. Soon I learned the password and it was: Meeting makers make it. I was soon to find out what that meant.<br><br>I was offered a seat by the very tall lady, and she got us coffee. The coffee was good, very strong, the kind that would grow hair on your chest, they said. Why the heck would I want to have a hairy chest, except to date a gorilla? A gorilla is probably nicer than some people I know. I was then told that the coffeemaker job was the best job in the world. I worked in a restaurant and bar and I knew how to make coffee. I was able to smile and even laugh. I was a nurse for 40 years. Nurses are coffee connoisseurs. The bolder the better.<br><br>This was a big meeting, very big, and the people read from this book called Daily Reflections. The book was full of short little stories and each person spoke. There were more than 80 people at the one-hour meeting and each person talked about the reading in one hour!<br><br>Some of the speakers were low talkers and you couldn’t hear them. Some yelled the message so loud you could hear them at the Cape Cod Canal. There were slow talkers and fast talkers. I’m a fast talker and so felt right at home.<br><br>I went back to that meeting again. The very tall lady with the crossed arms didn’t show up and I was kind of glad. I found out that there was no president of the group, although some people thought they were.<br><br>Each person has their own seat (like at church), and out of courtesy it was left empty for them. When you are new, just ask someone where to sit. I heard that people were there to claim their seat. I wasn’t quite sure what that meant. Did we get to take our chairs home? They were pretty nice chairs.<br><br>Everyone invited me to come back tomorrow for coffee. I thought these were really nice people. I was to learn later that the group would become the most important people I have ever known. Thank you, Bass River Morning Meeting in Dennis, Massachusetts. You kept me alive.</div>	Reading	55	2024-12-05 03:24:46.363563	2024-12-05 03:24:46.363563

115	content	<div>Since family life has suffered more than anything else, alcoholics are wise to work hard to fix things at home. They won’t make progress elsewhere if they can’t show unselfishness and love under their own roofs. We know there are difficult partners and families. But a person getting over alcoholism must remember they played a part in making their own families become difficult.<br><br>When family members start to see their own mistakes and admit them to the others, they pave the way for helpful discussion. The most useful family talks will take place without angry arguments, self-pity, excuses, or resentful criticism. Little by little, mom and the children will realize they are asking for too much. Dad will see he is giving them too little. Giving, rather than getting, will become their shared goal.<br><br>Now imagine that dad has had a life-changing spiritual experience at the beginning of his recovery. It may seem like he has changed overnight. He becomes very religious. He cannot focus on or talk about anything else. Once his sobriety becomes normal, the family may look at their strange new dad nervously. Later, they may feel annoyed with him. He talks about spiritual matters morning, noon, and night. He may insist that everyone in the family find God for themselves, and fast. Or he may seem like he doesn’t care about them at all, and act like he’s better than everyone else. He may tell mom that she doesn’t know what religion is all about, even if she’s been religious all her life.<br><br>When dad acts this way, the family may react angrily. They may be jealous of a God who has stolen dad’s attention and love. They feel grateful that he’s stopped drinking, but they might not like that a Higher Power could heal dad when they could not. They forget that no human power could help him. They might not see why their love didn’t save him. Their jealousy might turn another way. Dad isn’t so spiritual after all, they say. If he’s going to right his past wrongs, why is he focused on everyone in the world except his family? Then he says that God will take care of them. They start to think dad is losing his mind.<br><br>He’s not as unbalanced as they might think. Many of us have experienced dad’s joy and bliss. We have felt spiritual intoxication. Like a skinny, starving gold miner who has just struck gold. We feel unending joy once we are free from our frustrating lives. Dad feels like he has struck something better than gold. For a while, he may try to keep the treasure to himself. He doesn’t see that he has access to an endless supply of riches. Riches that will only make him wealthy if he mines for the rest of his life and gives it all away.<br><br>If the family is patient, dad will see that he is taking his new beliefs too far. He’ll know that his spiritual growth cannot take over his life. A spiritual life that doesn’t include his family might not be so perfect after all. If the family can accept that dad’s behavior is just a phase in his journey, it will pass. An understanding and sympathetic family will help dad grow beyond this stage.</div>	Reading	58	2024-12-21 15:52:35.500447	2024-12-21 16:08:55.819336

117	content	<div>Sometimes, the holidays are filled with the joy we associate with that time of year. The season flows. Magic is in the air.<br><br>Sometimes, the holidays can be difficult and lonely.<br><br>Here are some ideas I’ve learned through personal experience, and practice, to help us get through difficult holidays:<br><br>Deal with feelings, but try not to dwell unduly on them. Put the holidays in perspective: A holiday is one day out of 365. We can get through any 24-hour period.<br><br>Get through the day, but be aware that there may be a post- holiday backlash. Sometimes, if we use our survival behaviors to get through the day, the feelings will catch up to us the next day. Deal with them too. Get back on track as quickly as possible.<br><br>Find and cherish the love that’s available, even if it’s not exactly what we want. Is there someone we can give love to and receive love from? Recovering friends? Is there a family who would enjoy sharing their holiday with us? Don’t be a martyr; go. There may be those who would appreciate our offer to share our day with them.<br><br>We are not in the minority if we find ourselves experiencing a less-than-ideal holiday. How easy, but untrue, to tell ourselves the rest of the world is experiencing the perfect holiday, and we’re alone in conflict.<br><br>We can create our own holiday agenda. Buy yourself a present. Find someone to whom you can give. Unleash your loving, nurturing self and give in to the holiday spirit.<br><br>Maybe past holidays haven’t been terrific. Maybe this year wasn’t terrific. But next year can be better, and the next a little better. Work toward a better life—one that meets your needs. Before long, you’ll have it.<br><br></div><blockquote><em>God, help me enjoy and cherish this holiday. If my situation is less than ideal, help me take what’s good and let go of the rest.</em></blockquote><div><br></div>	Reading	59	2024-12-26 03:30:50.971129	2024-12-26 03:40:59.069025
121	content	<div>At age 42, I walked in the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous and for the first time in my life I came to feel really safe. I didn’t know right away what the name of it was, but there was something in the rooms I could sense and soon I was feeling it—even as I also often felt that it might work for you, but not me. But I kept feeling it and eventually realized that what I was feeling was hope. The program gave me hope—and when hope enters despair vanishes and depression lifts. Now with 40 years sober, I have found so much more in these rooms.<br><br>One of the things I discovered along the way is that we each need to find our bliss—to “sing our songs.” If we don’t sing them, they will never be sung. We are all unique and we are each here to to live a life that no one else will live for us. Nobody is ever going to come along and say, “Well, I think I’m going to live Bob’s life for him, I can do it better.” Maybe they could, but they aren’t going to do it. So look, and keep looking, until you find what it is you are meant to do—and then do it!<br><br>As I turn 83, it amazes me that I was lucky enough at age 20 to find my way to New York and into the theatre—to be a part of that magic, the song of the theatre—all this time. Because of mistakes I made, I did not get to sing all the songs I was supposed to sing, but as I got sober and back on track, I sang all that I could. And looking back, I can report it provided me with a life full of magic and adventure and was big enough and interesting enough for me so that now I feel whole.<br><br>While I do have some regrets for things missed, they don’t have much hold on me anymore, and I have enormous gratitude for the people and the things that I did not miss. My career was never big and starry, never one that left its mark on the world in terms of fame and fortune, but it made its mark on me and was rewarding to me. For all the missteps and disappointments, there were many accomplishments in my journey from there to here. So regrets, yes, some—even quite a few—but also rewards galore, just of a different size perhaps. They were smaller victories, smaller stars and comets than I wanted and imagined were possible back then along the early way, but they are victories, nonetheless. And now, rather like looking up on a starry night, there have been so many they are hard to count. With acceptance and effort and stamina and commitment, my life renewed and continues to renew every day in sobriety.<br><br></div>	Reading	61	2024-12-30 03:32:33.668175	2024-12-30 03:32:33.668175

123	content	<div>I had heard of AA for some time and although I thought I might have a problem I didn't think I was an alcoholic. I figured if I went to a meeting I would be admitting I was an alcoholic and there would be no turning back; I would be doomed for life. I was a person with low self-esteem and quite shy. <br><br></div><div>Anyway, it's not like I drank all day. I would wait until after 5:00 after I got home from work to start. When I stopped working it got a bit earlier, say 4:30. Then a little earlier still, but usually never before 3:30.<br><br></div><div>I had been drinking daily for nearly 40 years when one day at a doctor appointment my doctor went over my recent blood test with me. It turned out my liver enzymes were elevated. I questioned the doctor about the meaning of this and whether I could have cirrhosis of the liver. He said he didn't know, but that I should really consider quitting drinking—now. This scared me. I had heard that cirrhosis was a death sentence and of course my mind immediately went there. So I checked myself into a residential treatment facility for 30 days thinking I'll straighten out my liver and then go back to drinking. You see, I never thought I had hit "bottom" because I never lost a job, home or family over it. (Never mind that I wrecked two or three cars while driving intoxicated. Thankfully they were all single car accidents.) <br><br></div><div>While in this live-in treatment facility, we were watched pretty constantly. We could not go outside unsupervised except to go to an AA meeting or church on Sundays. I went to three AA meetings while I was living there. When I "graduated" they impressed upon me the importance of attending 90 meetings in 90 days. <br><br></div><div>Well, I didn't do that, but I did continue to go to AA meetings. I eventually found my home group which includes some of the most amazing women I have ever known. At age 62 I have now learned more about myself and life that I never knew I didn't know. I am forever grateful for this wonderful group of women. Through AA, my beautiful "sisters" and my sponsor, I have learned how to live life bravely, honestly and sincerely. Best of all, I have grown spiritually since I've been in AA, and I continue to grow.<br><br></div>	Reading	62	2025-01-02 02:49:49.120941	2025-01-02 03:20:26.335225
125	content	<div>The AA program only suggests that newcomers attempt to begin to conceive of a power greater than themselves, in their own individual terms. After that, an oldtimer might suggest to a skeptical newcomer—along with not picking up the first drink—faking prayer and keeping an open mind.<br><br></div><div>I came into this program a drunken atheist. Today, I pray. My being sober is a reflection of the good attributes of some Higher Power; it is not a reflection of any moral virtue or strength of will on my part.<br><br></div><div>This change in a drunken, hardcore, cynical atheist is a miracle beyond human comprehension. However, one aspect of the program has always been required for me to remain sober—results. Prayer works. If prayer didn’t work and show results, I’d become an atheist again today.<br><br></div><div>Spirituality happens to be extremely practical. Prayer, reading the AA literature, going to meetings, using the Steps, and helping another alcoholic all combine to make my life easier and more comfortable, hour to hour, day to day.<br><br></div><div>As an atheist, I faked prayer on a trial basis in the beginning. The results have altered my viewpoint of the cosmos. An unseen realm does exist. I do not attend church, nor have I experienced a spiritual awakening; I’m still a fire-breathing cynic. Yet I pray regularly to something unseen and so vast that I, as a human being, can never understand or even name it.<br><br></div><div>I pray because of the positive results that flow from prayer. I’m a pragmatist. So for today, I have become an agnostic, who occasionally experiences violent swings toward faith. With all the blessings that have been bestowed upon me in a year and a half, I still experience doubts and have not made that quantum leap to faith.<br><br></div><div>All this proves only one thing: that some nuts are tougher to crack than others. Today, I’m still faking prayer and getting results. Maybe God likes nuts, especially the hard ones.<br><br><br></div>	Reading	63	2025-01-16 03:02:07.138899	2025-01-16 03:02:07.138899

129	body	<div>It’s very rare for someone to completely commit to the A.A. program and still fail. People who do not recover are the ones who can’t or won’t follow this simple program. They are usually people who simply cannot be honest with themselves. We don’t meet a lot of people like this, but they do exist. It is not their fault. They seem to have been born that way. But because they cannot be honest with themselves, they are unlikely to succeed in their recovery.<br>   There are also people who suffer from emotional and mental disorders, and join A.A. to address their alcoholism. Many of them do recover if they are able to be honest along their journey.<br>   Many of the stories we share in this book describe experiences that we have had ourselves. We share stories about what we used to be like, what happened to us, and what our lives are like now. If you feel like we did and want to stop drinking, then you are ready to get started. You are ready to take these steps toward recovery.<br>   When we started, some of those first steps scared us. We thought we could find an easier way. But we could not. Since we know this now from our own experiences, we’re asking you to be fearless and thorough from the start. Some of us tried to keep our old ideas, and they just held us back. Until we let go of those ideas, we were unable to make progress.<br>   Remember that we are dealing with a disease. Alcoholism is a confusing and powerful condition that is unlike anything else in the world. Alcohol is extremely complicated, tricky, and difficult. It seems to control and punish people who are addicted to it. Without help, beating alcoholism is too much for one person to handle. We all need guidance from God, support from a Higher Power. And we need to ask for that support with full and open hearts. We stand at a turning point. We ask for God’s protection and care with all the honesty we have.<br><br></div><div>Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:</div><div><strong>1. </strong>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.<br><strong>2. </strong>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.<br><strong>3.</strong> Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God<em> as we understood Him.</em><br><strong>4. </strong>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br><strong>5. </strong>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.<br><strong>6.</strong> Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.<br><strong>7.</strong> Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.<br><strong>8. </strong>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.<br><strong>9.</strong> Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.<br><strong>10. </strong>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.<br><strong>11.</strong> Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God<em> as we understood Him, </em>praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.<br><strong>12. </strong>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br><br>   If this is your first time reading through these steps, they may seem difficult ... or even impossible. Do not be discouraged. No one has ever followed these principles perfectly. We are not saints. We are simply people who are trying to grow, both spiritually and personally. These ideas are here to guide our progress. And our goal is spiritual progress, not spiritual perfection.<br>   In Chapter 4 we shared a description of alcoholics who do not believe in God. Combined with that, we believe the stories of our experiences as A.A. members all boil down to three simple ideas:<br><br>   A. That we were alcoholics and could not manage our own lives.<br>   B. That no human power could have stopped or changed our alcoholism.<br>   C. That God could and would help us if we tried to find God.</div>	ServiceReading	1	2025-01-29 01:33:58.01154	2025-01-29 01:33:58.01154
130	body	<div>Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.<br>   Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it—then you are ready to take certain steps.<br>   At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.<br>   Remember that we deal with alcohol—cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power—that One is God. May you find Him now!<br>   Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point.

I can’t go through with it.’’ Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.<br>   Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:<br><br>   <strong>(a)</strong> That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.<br>   <strong>(b) </strong>That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism.<br>   <strong>(c) </strong>That God could and would if He were sought</div>	ServiceReading	2	2025-01-29 01:41:27.281059	2025-02-07 16:02:18.222966

136	content	<div>Your new friend may give reasons why they don’t need to complete all of the program. They may rebel at the thought of doing a thorough house cleaning (inventory). They may not want to talk with other people about their problems. Don’t argue with them. Tell them you once felt the same way. Say you don’t think you would have made much progress if you took no action.<br><br>Unless your friend wants to talk further about their own experiences, don’t force them. You don’t want to wear out your welcome. Give them a chance to think it over. If you do stay, let them steer the conversation in any direction they want. Sometimes a person is anxious to start the program right away. You may be tempted to let them do just that. Sometimes this is a mistake. If the problem drinker has trouble later on, they may say you made them feel rushed. You will be most successful with other alcoholics if you don’t act pushy or judgmental. <br><br>Never talk down to an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual perspective. Just lay out the kit of spiritual tools for them to look at. Show them how the tools worked for you. Offer them friendship and fellowship. Tell them that if they want to get well, you will do anything to help. If they are not interested in doing the work of A.A., you will know. If the person wants you to lend them money or act like a nurse when they go on drinking sprees, you might even stop helping them. You’ll need to wait until they change their own mind. This might not happen until they get hurt some more.<br><br>If they are truly interested and want to see you again, ask them to read this book before your next meeting. After doing that, they must decide on their own whether or not to go on. They should not be pushed or prodded by you, their family, or their friends. If they are to connect with a Higher Power, the desire must come from within.<br><br>If the individual thinks they can stop drinking in some other way, or prefers some other spiritual approach, encourage them to do what they think is best for them. A.A. does not believe there is one right path to faith. We just have an approach that worked for us. But point out that we alcoholics have a lot in common and you’d like to keep in touch. Let it go at that.<br><br>Don’t be discouraged if your new friend doesn’t join A.A. right away. Find another alcoholic and try again. It won’t take long to find someone desperate enough to accept what you offer. It’s a waste of time to keep chasing someone who cannot or will not work with you. If you leave such a person alone, they may soon realize that they cannot recover by themselves.

We may have believed we deserved mistreatment; we may have been attracted to people who mistreated us.<br>   We need to let go, on a deep level, of our need to be victimized and to be victims. We need to let go of our need to be in dysfunctional relationships and systems at work, in love, in family relationships, in friendships. We deserve better. We deserve much better. It is our right. When we believe in our right to happiness, we will have happiness.<br>   We will fight for that right, and the fight will emerge from our souls. Break free from oppression and victimization.<br><br><strong><em>Today, I will liberate myself by letting go of my need to be a victim. and I’ll explore my freedom to take care of myself. That liberation will not take me further away from people I love. It will bring me closer to people and more in harmony with God’s plan for my life.</em></strong><br><br></div>	Reading	68	2025-02-06 02:05:39.62277	2025-02-06 02:07:40.87199
142	content	<div>Many new people have come to A.A. who wanted to keep their lives secret. They wanted to avoid discussing the truth about their lives with anyone. Even if they did everything else in the A.A. program and followed all of the other 11 Steps, these people almost always struggled to stay sober. At some point, they got drunk. They were unable to control themselves and wondered why they started drinking again.<br><br>We think the reason is that they never completed their “house cleaning.” They started to take inventory, but didn’t finish the process. They thought they had gotten rid of their selfishness and fear, but they had not. They thought they had learned to be humble, but they had not. They had not learned enough about selfishness and fear because they had not told someone else their complete life story.<br><br>One reason it’s hard for alcoholics to know when we have told our entire life stories is this: Many alcoholics lead double lives. We are like actors. When we are around other people, we act like a character on stage, showing them the version of ourselves we want them to see. We pretend to be people we are not so others will like us. Even when we know we don’t deserve to be liked.<br><br>Leading a double life becomes harder when we go on drinking sprees. Once we get sober, we may remember how we acted when we were drunk and feel disgusted with ourselves. Realizing someone else may have seen us act this way is very upsetting. These memories are like nightmares. We may push them deep inside ourselves so we don’t have to face them. Feeling this way makes us feel constantly afraid and tense, which can lead to more drinking.<br><br>Psychologists tend to agree that alcoholics struggle to be honest with themselves, and also struggle to be honest with others. Many of us have spent thousands of dollars working with psychologists, never feeling able to tell them the whole truth. We couldn’t take their advice, no matter how kind they were to us. We couldn’t be honest with our psychologists or anyone else. No wonder so many doctors believe alcoholics can’t recover!</div>	Reading	69	2025-02-11 03:36:49.853911	2025-02-11 03:36:49.853911

146	content	<div><strong>Once we have accepted</strong> A.A.’s principles, we can do all kinds of things alcoholics are not supposed to do. People say we can’t go where liquor is served and we must not have it in our homes. They say we can’t spend time with friends who drink. They tell us not to watch movies or TV shows that show people drinking. They say our friends must hide their bottles if we go to their houses. They insist we can’t think about alcohol at all. Our experience shows that this is not actually true.<br><br>   We are in situations involving alcohol every day. An alcoholic who cannot deal with them still has an alcoholic mind. That person hasn’t truly found their faith or connected with their Higher Power. Their only chance for sobriety would be to move someplace like the North Pole. And even there, someone might show up with a bottle of scotch and ruin everything! Ask any spouse who has sent their alcoholic partner to distant places thinking it would solve the alcohol problem. It never works.<br><br>   We believe that any method of fighting alcoholism that protects the alcoholic from temptation will fail. If the alcoholic tries to protect themself, that may work for a while. But they usually end up going on the biggest drinking spree ever. We have tried these methods. They are attempts to do the impossible, and they have always failed. <br><br>   So our rule is not to avoid places where there is drinking, if we have a real reason for being there. That includes bars, nightclubs, dances, receptions, weddings, even plain ordinary parties. To someone who has had experience with an alcoholic, this may seem like tempting fate, but it isn’t.<br><br>   You may notice that we said we need “a real reason for being there.” As an alcoholic who is thinking of going to a bar or party, ask yourself, “Do I have any good social, business, or personal reason for going to this place? Or am I hoping to get some secondhand pleasure from watching other people drink?” If you answer these questions honestly, you don’t need to worry. Go or stay away, whichever feels right. But make sure you are on solid spiritual ground before you consider going. Also make sure your reasons for going are thoroughly good. Don’t think about what you will get out of the experience. Think of what you can bring to it. And if you feel shaky or unsure, work with another alcoholic instead of putting yourself at risk!<br><br>   Don’t allow yourself to be grouchy or sullen in places where people are drinking. Don’t let yourself sigh about the good old days. If it is a happy occasion, join others in celebrating. If you’re there for business, focus on business discussions with enthusiasm. If you are with a person who wants to eat in a bar, feel free to go along. Let your friends know they don’t need to change their habits on your account. When the time feels right, explain to all your friends why alcohol is a problem for you. If you do this thoroughly, very few people will pressure you to drink. While you were drinking, you were withdrawing from life little by little. Now you are returning to the social life of this world. Don’t start to withdraw again just because your friends drink alcohol.<br><br>   Your job now is to be as helpful as possible to others. Never hesitate to go anywhere if you can be helpful. You can visit the most dirty, dangerous spot on earth if you go there to be helpful. Keep on the firing line of life with these motives and God will keep you unharmed.<br><br>   Many recovering alcoholics keep liquor in our homes. We often need it to get newcomers through a severe hangover. Some of us still serve it to our friends as long as they are not alcoholics. But others think we should not serve liquor to anyone. We never argue about this question. We feel that each family is unique, and can decide for themselves.<br><br>   We are careful never to become intolerant about drinking in general. That attitude is not helpful to anyone. Every newcomer to A.A. seems worried that we will all be hateful about other people’s drinking. They are all relieved when they see we are not. Intolerance of all drinking might discourage alcoholics whose lives could have been saved. They might never try to learn about A.A. for fear of being judged. That kind of intolerance is totally useless. There isn’t a drinker alive who likes to be told anything about alcohol by someone who hates it.<br><br>   Someday we hope that Alcoholics Anonymous will help the public understand the seriousness of alcoholism. We will never reach that goal with an attitude of bitterness or hostility. Drinkers will not stand for it.<br><br>   After all, we created our own problems. Bottles were only a symbol. Besides, we have stopped fighting anybody or anything. We don’t have a problem with anyone who drinks. We don’t even fight alcohol. We just don’t need it!<br><br></div>	Reading	71	2025-02-18 03:28:16.061723	2025-02-18 03:28:34.486184

We cannot control what others want, what they expect, or what they want us to do and be.</div><div><br>   We can control how we respond to other people’s expectations. During the course of any day, people may make demands on our time, talents, energy, money, and emotions. We do not have to say yes to every request. We do not have to feel guilty if we say no. And we do not have to allow the barrage of demands to control the course of our life.<br><br>   We do not have to spend our life reacting to others and to the course they would prefer we took with our life.<br><br>   We can set boundaries, firm limits on how far we shall go with others.

We live or own life by not letting other people, their expectations, and their demands control the course of <em>our </em>life.

150	content	<div>We found ourselves wondering how people who loved their families could be so unthinking, so insensitive, so cruel. They weren’t capable of feeling love, we thought. But just as we had decided for good that our partners were heartless, they would surprise us with promises to change. For a while they would be their old sweet selves, but then they would smash our love to pieces all over again. Whenever we asked why they had started to drink again, they would reply with some silly excuse, or offer us no reason at all. It was so confusing, so heartbreaking. Could we have been so wrong about the people we chose to spend our lives with? When they were drinking, they were strangers. Sometimes they were so emotionally distant that it seemed like a giant wall had been built around them.<br><br>And even if they didn’t love their families, how could they be so blind about themselves? Where had their judgment, common sense, and willpower gone? Why couldn’t they see that drinking was ruining their lives? And when anyone pointed out how dangerous drinking was, why would they get drunk again immediately?<br><br>These are some of the questions which race through the mind of every partner with an alcoholic loved one. Perhaps your partner has been living in that strange world of alcoholism where everything is twisted and exaggerated. You can see that your partner really does love you with their better self. Some people are just incompatible, meaning they aren’t meant to be together. But in cases where one partner is alcoholic and the alcoholic seems unloving and inconsiderate, it’s usually because they are suffering and sick. It’s the sickness making them act that way.<br><br>Try not to judge or punish your partner no matter what they say or do. They are a very sick, unreasonable person. Treat them, when you can, as though they have pneumonia. When they make you angry, remember that they are very ill.<br><br>However, there’s an important exception to this rule. Some people really do have bad intentions, and being patient with them won’t make any difference. An alcoholic who is like this may try to use what we’ve said in this chapter against you. Don’t let them get away with it. If you are sure your partner is bad intentioned, you may decide to end the relationship. Is it right to let this person ruin your life and the lives of your children? Especially when they have a way to stop drinking and treating you badly if only they were willing to put in the work?<br><br></div>	Reading	73	2025-02-25 03:31:06.934594	2025-02-25 03:31:06.934594

169	body	<div><strong>Rarely have we seen a person fail</strong> who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually people who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.<br><br>Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps.<br><br>At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.<br><br>Remember that we deal with alcohol — cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power — that One is God. May you find God now!<br><br>Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked God’s protection and care with complete abandon.<br><br>Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:<br><br><strong>1.</strong> We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — that our lives had become unmanageable.<br><strong>2. </strong>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.<br><strong>3.</strong> Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God.<br><strong>4.</strong> Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br><strong>5. </strong>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.<br><strong>6.</strong> Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.<br><strong>7.</strong> Humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings.<br><strong>8. </strong>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.<br><strong>9.</strong> Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.<br><strong>10.</strong> Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.<br><strong>11. </strong>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood God, praying only for knowledge of God’s will for us and the power to carry that out.<br><strong>12.</strong> Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br><br>Many of us exclaimed, <em>“What an order! I can’t go through with it.’</em>’ Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.<br><br>Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:<br><br><strong>(a)</strong> That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. <br><strong>(b)</strong> That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. <br><strong>(c)</strong> That God could and would if God were sought.</div>	ServiceReading	6	2025-04-13 01:01:11.499635	2025-04-13 01:03:33.984516

Chapters describing the A.A. recovery program — the original Twelve Steps — and the personal histories of A.A.'s co-founders remain unchanged since the original, while new stories have been added to the personal histories with each edition.

To show other alcoholics PRECISELY HOW WE HAVE RECOVERED is the main purpose of this book. For them, we hope these pages will prove so convincing that no further authentication will be necessary. We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living has its advantages for all.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_2_paragraph_2" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we remain anonymous because we are too few, at present to handle the overwhelming number of personal appeals which may result from this publication. Being mostly business or professional folk, we could not well carry on our occupations in such an event. We would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an avocation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_2_paragraph_3" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When writing or speaking publicly about alcoholism, we urge each of our Fellowship to omit his personal name, designating himself instead as "a member of Alcoholics Anonymous."</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_2_paragraph_4" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very earnestly we ask the press also, to observe this request, for otherwise we shall be greatly handicapped. We are not an organization in the conventional sense of the word. There are no fees or dues whatsoever. The only requirement for membership is an honest desire to stop drinking. We are not allied with any particular faith, sect or denomination, nor do we oppose anyone. We simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_2_paragraph_5" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be interested to hear from those who are getting results from this book, particularly from those who have commenced work with other alcoholics. We should like to be helpful to such cases.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_2_paragraph_6" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquiry by scientific, medical, and religious societies will be welcomed.</p>\r\n</div>	2024-01-24 00:59:51.293055	2024-01-24 00:59:51.293055
2	1	THE DOCTOR'S OPINION	0	<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_1" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;WE OF Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the reader will be interested in the medical estimate of the plan of recovery described in this book. Convincing testimony must surely come from medical men who have had experience with the sufferings of our members and have witnessed our return to health. A well-known doctor, chief physician at a nationally prominent hospital specializing in alcoholic and drug addiction, gave Alcoholics Anonymous this letter:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_2" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>To Whom It May Concern:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have specialized in the treatment of alcoholism for many years.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In late 1934 I attended a patient who, though he had been a competent businessman of good earning capacity, was an alcoholic of a type I had come to regard as hopeless.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_3" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of his third treatment he acquired certain ideas concerning a possible means of recovery. As part of his rehabilitation he commenced to present his conceptions to other alcoholics, impressing upon them that they must do likewise with still others. This has become the basis of a rapidly growing fellowship of these men and their families. This man and over one hundred others appear to have recovered.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I personally know scores of cases who were of the type with whom other methods had failed completely.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_4" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; These facts appear to be of extreme medical importance; because of the extraordinary possibilities of rapid growth inherent in this group they may mark a new epoch in the annals of alcoholism. These men may well have a remedy for thousands of such situations.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You may rely absolutely on anything they say about themselves.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_5" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"><br>Very truly yours, &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>William D. Silkworth, M.D.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_6" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_7" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>The physician who, at our request, gave us this letter, has been kind enough to enlarge upon his views in another statement which follows. In this statement he confirms what we who have suffered alcoholic torture must believe&mdash;that the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal as his mind. It did not satisfy us to be told that we could not control our drinking just because we were maladjusted to life, that we were in full flight from reality, or were outright mental defectives. These things were true to some extent, in fact, to a considerable extent with some of us. But we are sure that our bodies were sickened as well. In our belief, any picture of the alcoholic which leaves out this physical factor is incomplete.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_8" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The doctor's theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense. It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_9" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Though we work out our solution on the spiritual as well as an altruistic plane, we favor hospitalization for the alcoholic who is very jittery or befogged. More often than not, it is imperative that a man's brain be cleared before he is approached, as he has then a better chance of understanding and accepting what we have to offer.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_10" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; The doctor writes:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_11" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The subject presented in this book seems to me to be of paramount importance to those afflicted with alcoholic addiction.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I say this after many years&rsquo; experience as Medical Director of one of the oldest hospitals in the country treating alcoholic and drug addiction.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when I was asked to contribute a few words on a subject which is covered in such masterly detail in these pages.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_12" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; We doctors have realized for a long time that some form of moral psychology was of urgent importance to alcoholics, but its application presented difficulties beyond our conception. What with our ultra-modern standards, our scientific approach to everything, we are perhaps not well equipped to apply the powers of good that lie outside our synthetic knowledge.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_13" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Many years ago one of the leading contributors to this book came under our care in this hospital and while here he acquired some ideas which he put into practical application at once.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Later, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell his story to other patients here and with some misgiving, we consented. The cases we have followed through have been most interesting; in fact, many of them are amazing. The unselfishness of these men as we have come to know them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their community spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who has labored long and wearily in this alcoholic field. They believe in themselves, and still more in the Power which pulls chronic alcoholics back from the gates of death.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_14" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course an alcoholic ought to be freed from his physical craving for liquor, and this often requires a definite hospital procedure, before psychological measures can be of maximum benefit.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; We believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the action of alcohol on these chronic alcoholics is a manifestation of an allergy; that the phenomenon of craving is limited to this class and never occurs in the average temperate drinker. These allergic types can never safely use alcohol in any form at all; and once having formed the habit and found they cannot break it, once having lost their self-confidence, their reliance upon things human, their problems pile up on them and become astonishingly difficult to solve.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_15" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Frothy emotional appeal seldom suffices. The message which can interest and hold these alcoholic people must have depth and weight. In nearly all cases, their ideals must be grounded in a power greater than themselves, if they are to re-create their lives.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_16" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for alcoholics we appear somewhat sentimental, let them stand with us a while on the firing line, see the tragedies, the despairing wives, the little children; let the solving of these problems become a part of their daily work, and even of their sleeping moments, and the most cynical will not wonder that we have accepted and encouraged this movement. We feel, after many years of experience, that we have found nothing which has contributed more to the rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic movement now growing up among them.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_17" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Men and women drink essentially because they like the effect produced by alcohol. The sensation is so elusive that, while they admit it is injurious, they cannot after a time differentiate the true from the false. To them, their alcoholic life seems the only normal one. They are restless, irritable and discontented, unless they can again experience the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few drinks-drinks which they see others taking with impunity. After they have succumbed to the desire again, as so many do, and the phenomenon of craving develops, they pass through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution not to drink again. This is repeated over and over, and unless this person can experience an entire psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_18" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand&mdash;and strange as this may seem to those who do not understand&mdash;once a psychic change has occurred, the very same person who seemed doomed, who had so many problems he despaired of ever solving them, suddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for alcohol, the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_19" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal: "Doctor, I cannot go on like this! I have everything to live for! I must stop, but I cannot! You must help me!"</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_20" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Faced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with himself, he must sometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although he gives all that is in him, it often is not enough. One feels that something more than human power is needed to produce the essential psychic change. Though the aggregate of recoveries resulting from psychiatric effort is considerable, we physicians must admit we have made little impression upon the problem as a whole. Many types do not respond to the ordinary psychological approach.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_21" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not hold with those who believe that alcoholism is entirely a problem of mental control. I have had many men who had, for example, worked a period of months on some problem or business deal which was to be settled on a certain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day or so prior to the date, and then the phenomenon of craving at once became paramount to all other interests so that the important appointment was not met. These men were not drinking to escape; they were drinking to overcome a craving beyond their mental control.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_22" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon of craving which cause men to make the supreme sacrifice rather than continue to fight.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_23" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The classification of alcoholics seems most difficult, and in much detail is outside the scope of this book. There are, of course, the psychopaths who are emotionally unstable. We are all familiar with this type. They are always "going on the wagon for keeps." They are over-remorseful and make many resolutions, but never a decision.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_24" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that he cannot take a drink. He plans various ways of drinking. He changes his brand or his environment. There is the type who always believes that after being entirely free from alcohol for a period of time he can take a drink without danger. There is the manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps, the least understood by his friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be written.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_25" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there are types entirely normal in every respect except in the effect alcohol has upon them. They are often able, intelligent, friendly people.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; All these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they cannot start drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving. This phenomenon, as we have suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy which differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct entity. It has never been, by any treatment with which we are familiar, permanently eradicated. The only relief we have to suggest is entire abstinence.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_26" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron of debate. Much has been written pro and con, but among physicians, the general opinion seems to be that most chronic alcoholics are doomed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_27" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this by relating one of my experiences.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_28" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; About one year prior to this experience a man was brought in to be treated for chronic alcoholism. He had but partially recovered from a gastric hemorrhage and seemed to be a case of pathological mental deterioration. He had lost everything worthwhile in life and was only living, one might say, to drink. He frankly admitted and believed that for him there was no hope. Following the elimination of alcohol, there was found to be no permanent brain injury. He accepted the plan outlined in this book. One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a very strange sensation. I knew the man by name, and partly recognized his features, but there all resemblance ended. From a trembling, despairing, nervous wreck, had emerged a man brimming over with self-reliance and contentment. I talked with him for some time, but was not able to bring myself to feel that I had known him before. To me he was a stranger, and so he left me. A long time has passed with no return to alcohol.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_29" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; When I need a mental uplift, I often think of another case brought in by a physician prominent in New York. The patient had made his own diagnosis, and deciding his situation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted barn determined to die. He was rescued by a searching party, and, in desperate condition, brought to me. Following his physical rehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he frankly stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort, unless I could assure him, which no one ever had, that in the future he would have the "will power" to resist the impulse to drink.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_30" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; His alcoholic problem was so complex, and his depression so great, that we felt his only hope would be through what we then called "moral psychology," and we doubted if even that would have any effect.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_31" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, he did become "sold" on the ideas contained in this book. He has not had a drink for a great many years. I see him now and then and he is as fine a specimen of manhood as one could wish to meet.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_32" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I earnestly advise every alcoholic to read this book through, and though perhaps he came to scoff, he may remain to pray.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_3_paragraph_33" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>William D.

The drive for success was on. I'd prove to the world I was important. My work took me about Wall Street and little by little I became interested in the market. Many people lost money&mdash;but some became very rich. Why not I? I studied economics and business as well as law. Potential alcoholic that I was, I nearly failed my law course. At one of the finals I was too drunk to think or write. Though my drinking was not yet continuous, it disturbed my wife. We had long talks when I would still her forebodings by telling her that men of genius conceived their best projects when drunk; that the most majestic constructions of philosophic thought were so derived.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_12" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_13" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">2:2</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I had completed the course, I knew the law was not for me. The inviting maelstrom of Wall Street had me in its grip. Business and financial leaders were my heroes. Out of this alloy of drink and speculation, I commenced to forge the weapon that one day would turn in its flight like a boomerang and all but cut me to ribbons. Living modestly, my wife and I saved $1,000. It went into certain securities, then cheap and rather unpopular. I rightly imagined that they would some day have a great rise. I failed to persuade my broker friends to send me out looking over factories and managements, but my wife and I decided to go anyway. I had developed a theory that most people lost money in stocks through ignorance of markets. I discovered many more reasons later on.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_14" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_15" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">2:3</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;We gave up our positions and off we roared on a motorcycle, the sidecar stuffed with tent, blankets, a change of clothes, and three huge volumes of a financial</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_16" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_17" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">3:0</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;reference service. Our friends thought a lunacy commission should be appointed. Perhaps they were right. I had had some success at speculation, so we had a little money, but we once worked on a farm for a month to avoid drawing on our small capital. That was the last honest manual labor on my part for many a day. We covered the whole eastern United States in a year. At the end of it, my reports to Wall Street procured me a position there and the use of a large expense account. The exercise of an option brought in more money, leaving us with a profit of several thousand dollars for that year.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_18" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_19" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">3:1</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years fortune threw money and applause my way. I had arrived. My judgment and ideas were followed by many to the tune of paper millions. The great boom of the late twenties was seething and swelling. Drink was taking an important and exhilarating part in my life. There was loud talk in the jazz places uptown. Everyone spent in thousands and chattered in millions. Scoffers could scoff and be damned. I made a host of fair-weather friends.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_20" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_21" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">3:2</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;My drinking assumed more serious proportions, continuing all day and almost every night.

After one of those days of inferno, I wobbled from a hotel bar to a brokerage office. It was eight o'clock&mdash;five hours after the market closed. The ticker still clattered. I was staring at an inch of the tape which bore the inscription XYZ-32. It had been 52 that morning. I was finished and so were many friends. The papers reported men jumping to death from the towers of High Finance. That disgusted me. I would not jump. I went back to the bar. My friends had dropped several million since ten o'clock&mdash;so what? Tomorrow was another day. As I drank, the old fierce determination to win came back.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_28" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_29" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">4:2</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Next morning I telephoned a friend in Montreal.

I found a job; then lost it as the result of a brawl with a taxi driver. Mercifully, no one could guess that I was to have no real employment for five years, or hardly draw a sober breath.

"Bathtub" gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine. Sometimes a small deal would net a few hundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the bars and delicatessens. This went on endlessly, and I began to waken very early in the morning shaking violently. A tumbler full of gin followed by half a dozen bottles of beer would be required if I were to eat any breakfast. Nevertheless, I still thought I could control the situation, and there were periods of sobriety which renewed my wife's hope.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_36" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_37" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">5:2</span> Gradually things got worse.

I could laugh at the gin mills. Now I had what it takes! One day I walked into a cafe to telephone. In no time I was beating on the bar asking myself how it happened.

The courage to do battle was not there. My brain raced uncontrollably and there was a terrible sense of impending calamity. I hardly dared cross the street, lest I collapse and be run down by an early morning truck, for it was scarcely daylight. An all night place supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale. My writhing nerves were stilled at last. A morning paper told me the market had gone to hell again. Well, so had I. The market would recover, but I wouldn't. That was a hard thought. Should I kill myself? No&mdash;not now. Then a mental fog settled down. Gin would fix that.

There were flights from city to country and back, as my wife and I sought escape. Then came the night when the physical and mental torture was so hellish I feared I would burst through my window, sash and all. Somehow I managed to drag my mattress to a lower floor, lest I suddenly leap.

Under the so-called belladonna treatment my brain cleared. Hydrotherapy and mild exercise helped much. Best of all, I met a kind doctor who explained that though certainly selfish and foolish, I had been seriously ill, bodily and mentally.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_56" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_57" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">7:2</span> It relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will is amazingly weakened when it comes to combating liquor, though it often remains strong in other respects. My incredible behavior in the face of a desperate desire to stop was explained. Understanding myself now, I fared forth in high hope. For three for four months the goose hung high. I went to town regularly and even made a little money.

The curve of my declining moral and bodily health fell off like a ski-jump. After a time I returned to the hospital. This was the finish, the curtain, it seemed to me. My weary and despairing wife was informed that it would all end with heart failure during delirium tremens, or I would develop a wet brain, perhaps within a year. She would soon have to give me over to the undertaker or the asylum.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_60" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_61" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">7:4</span> They did not need to tell me.

I, who had thought so well of myself and my abilities, of my capacity to surmount obstacles, was cornered at last.

Everyone became resigned to the certainty that I would have to be shut up somewhere, or would stumble along to a miserable end. How dark it is before the dawn! In reality that was the beginning of my last debauch. I was soon to be catapulted into what I like to call the fourth dimension of existence.

I wondered whether I dared hide a full bottle of gin near the head of our bed. I would need it before daylight.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_70" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_71" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">8:4</span> My musing was interrupted by the telephone.

He was sober. It was years since I could remember his coming to New York in that condition. I was amazed. Rumor had it that he had been committed for alcoholic insanity. I wondered how he had escaped. Of course he would have dinner, and then I could drink openly with him. Unmindful of his welfare, I thought only of recapturing the spirit of other days. There was that time we had chartered an airplane to complete a jag! His coming was an oasis in this dreary desert of futility. The very thing&mdash;an oasis! Drinkers are like that.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_74" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_75" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">9:1</span> The door opened and he stood there, fresh-skinned and glowing.

What had happened?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_76" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_77" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">9:2</span> I pushed a drink across the table.

So that was it&mdash;last summer an alcoholic crackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion. He had that starry-eyed look. Yes, the old boy was on fire all right.

Besides, my gin would last longer than his preaching.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_84" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_85" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">9:6</span> But he did no ranting.

Childhood memories rose before me. I could almost hear the sound of the preacher's voice as I sat, on still Sundays, way over there on the hillside; there was that proffered temperance pledge I never signed; my grandfather's good natured contempt of some church folk and their doings; his insistence that the spheres really had their music; but his denial of the preacher's right to tell him how he must listen; his fearlessness as he spoke of these things just before he died; these recollections welled up from the past.

Few people really are, for that means blind faith in the strange proposition that this universe originated in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere. My intellectual heroes, the chemists, the astronomers, even the evolutionists, suggested vast laws and forces at work. Despite contrary indications, I had little doubt that a mighty purpose and rhythm underlay all. How could there be so much of precise and immutable law, and no intelligence? I simply had to believe in a Spirit of the Universe, who knew neither time nor limitation. But that was as far as I had gone.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_96" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_97" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">10:4</span> With ministers, and the world's religions, I parted right there.

I honestly doubted whether, on balance, the religions of mankind had done any good. Judging from what I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest. If there was a Devil, he seemed the Boss Universal, and he certainly had me.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_102" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_103" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">11:3</span> But my friend sat before me, and he made the point-blank declaration that God had done for him what he could not do for himself. His human will had failed. Doctors had pronounced him incurable. Society was about to lock him up. Like myself, he had admitted complete defeat. Then he had, in effect, been raised from the dead, suddenly taken from the scrap heap to a level of life better than the best he had ever known!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_104" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_105" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">11:4</span> Had this power originated in him?

He shouted great tidings.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_108" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_109" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">11:6</span> I saw that my friend was much more than inwardly</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_110" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="chapter_4_paragraph_111" class="chapter-paragraph">\r\n<p><span class="text-secondary">12:0</span> reorganized.

This sometimes nearly drove me back to drink, but I soon found that when all other measures failed, work with another alcoholic would save the day.

5	1	MORE ABOUT ALCOHOLISM	3	<p>&nbsp;30:1 &nbsp;Most of us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics. No person likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;30:2 &nbsp;We learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics. This is the first step in recovery. The delusion that we are like other people, or presently may be, has to be smashed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;30:3 &nbsp;We alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our drinking. We know that no real alcoholic <em>ever</em> recovers control. All of us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such intervals&mdash;usually brief&mdash;were inevitably followed by still less control, which led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization. We are convinced to a man that alcoholics of our type are in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any considerable period we get worse, never better.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;30:4 &nbsp;We are like men who have lost their legs; they never grow new ones. Neither does there appear to be any kind of treatment which will make alcoholics of &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;31:0 &nbsp;our kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable remedy. In some instances there has been brief recovery, followed always by a still worse relapse. Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such thing as making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this, but it hasn't done so yet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;31:1 &nbsp;Despite all we can say, many who are real alcoholics are not going to believe they are in that class. By every form of self-deception and experimentation, they will try to prove themselves exceptions to the rule, therefore nonalcoholic. If anyone who is showing inability to control his drinking can do the right-about-face and drink like a gentleman, our hats are off to him. Heaven knows, we have tried hard enough and long enough to drink like other people!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;31:2 &nbsp;Here are some of the methods we have tried: Drinking beer only, limiting the number of drinks, never drinking alone, never drinking in the morning, drinking only at home, never having it in the house, never drinking during business hours, drinking only at parties, switching from scotch to brandy, drinking only natural wines, agreeing to resign if ever drunk on the job, taking a trip, not taking a trip, swearing off forever (with and without a solemn oath), taking more physical exercise, reading inspirational books, going to health farms and sanitariums, accepting voluntary commitment to asylums&mdash;we could increase the list ad infinitum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;31:3 &nbsp;We do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself. Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;32:0 &nbsp;more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your condition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;32:1 &nbsp;Though there is no way of proving it, we believe that early in our drinking careers most of us could have stopped drinking. But the difficulty is that few alcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time. We have heard of a few instances where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism, were able to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so. Here is one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;32:2 &nbsp;A man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking. He was very nervous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with more liquor. He was ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would get nowhere if he drank at all. Once he started, he had no control whatever. He made up his mind that until he had been successful in business and had retired, he would not touch another drop. An exceptional man, he remained bone dry for twenty-five years and retired at the age of fifty-five, after a successful and happy business career. Then he fell victim to a belief which practically every alcoholic has&mdash;that his long period of sobriety and self-discipline had qualified him to drink as other men. Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle. In two months he was in a hospital, puzzled and humiliated. He tried to regulate his drinking for a while, making several trips to the hospital meantime. Then, gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop altogether and found he could not. Every means of solving his problem which &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;33:0 &nbsp;money could buy was at his disposal. Every attempt failed. Though a robust man at retirement, he went to pieces quickly and was dead within four years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;33:1 &nbsp;This case contains a powerful lesson. Most of us have believed that if we remained sober for a long stretch, we could thereafter drink normally. But here is a man who at fifty-five years found he was just where he had left off at thirty. We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again: "Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic." Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;33:2 &nbsp;Young people may be encouraged by this man's experience to think that they can stop, as he did, on their own will power. We doubt if many of them can do it, because none will really want to stop, and hardly one of them, because of the peculiar mental twist already acquired, will find he can win out. Several of our crowd, men of thirty or less, had been drinking only a few years, but they found themselves as helpless as those who had been drinking twenty years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;33:3 &nbsp;To be gravely affected, one does not necessarily have to drink a long time nor take the quantities some of us have. This is particularly true of women. Potential female alcoholics often turn into the real thing and are gone beyond recall in a few years. Certain drinkers, who would be greatly insulted if called alcoholics, are astonished at their inability to stop. We, who are familiar with the symptoms, see large numbers of potential alcoholics among young &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;34:0 &nbsp;people everywhere. But try and get them to see it!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;34:1 &nbsp;As we look back, we feel we had gone on drinking many years beyond the point where we could quit on our will power. If anyone questions whether he has entered this dangerous area, let him try leaving liquor alone for one year. If he is a real alcoholic and very far advanced, there is scant chance of success. In the early days of our drinking we occasionally remained sober for a year or more, becoming serious drinkers again later. Though you may be able to stop for a considerable period, you may yet be a potential alcoholic. We think few, to whom this book will appeal, can stay dry anything like a year. Some will be drunk the day after making their resolutions; most of them within a few weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;34:2 &nbsp;For those who are unable to drink moderately the question is how to stop altogether. We are assuming, of course, that the reader desires to stop. Whether such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon the extent to which he has already lost the power to choose whether he will drink or not. Many of us felt that we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet we found it impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it&mdash;this utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;34:3 &nbsp;How then shall we help our readers determine, to their own satisfaction, whether they are one of us? The experiment of quitting for a period of time will be helpful, but we think we can render an even greater service to alcoholic sufferers and perhaps to the medical&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;35:0 &nbsp;fraternity. So we shall describe some of the mental states that precede a relapse into drinking, for obviously this is the crux of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;35:1 &nbsp;What sort of thinking dominates an alcoholic who repeats time after time the desperate experiment of the first drink? Friends who have reasoned with him after a spree which has brought him to the point of divorce or bankruptcy are mystified when he walks directly into a saloon. Why does he? Of what is he thinking?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;35:2 &nbsp;Our first example is a friend we shall call Jim. This man has a charming wife and family. He inherited a lucrative automobile agency. He had a commendable World War record. He is a good salesman. Everybody likes him. He is an intelligent man, normal so far as we can see, except for a nervous disposition. He did no drinking until he was thirty-five. In a few years he became so violent when intoxicated that he had to be committed. On leaving the asylum he came into contact with us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;35:3 &nbsp;We told him what we knew of alcoholism and the answer we had found. He made a beginning. His family was re-assembled, and he began to work as a salesman for the business he had lost through drinking. All went well for a time, but he failed to enlarge his spiritual life. To his consternation, he found himself drunk half a dozen times in rapid succession. On each of these occasions we worked with him, reviewing carefully what had happened. He agreed he was a real alcoholic and in a serious condition. He knew he faced another trip to the asylum if he kept on. Moreover, he would lose his family for whom he had a deep affection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;36:1 &nbsp;Yet he got drunk again. We asked him to tell us exactly how it happened. This is his story: "I came to work on Tuesday morning. I remember I felt irritated that I had to be a salesman for a concern I once owned. I had a few words with the boss, but nothing serious. Then I decided to drive into the country and see one of my prospects for a car. On the way I felt hungry so I stopped at a roadside place where they have a bar. I had no intention of drinking. I just thought I would get a sandwich. I also had the notion that I might find a customer for a car at this place, which was familiar for I had been going to it for years. I had eaten there many times during the months I was sober. I sat down at a table and ordered a sandwich and a glass of milk. Still no thought of drinking. I ordered another sandwich and decided to have another glass of milk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;36:2&nbsp; <em>Suddenly the thought crossed my mind that if I were to put an ounce of whiskey in my milk it couldn't hurt me on a full stomach. I ordered a whiskey and poured it into the milk. I vaguely sensed I was not being any too smart, but felt reassured as I was taking the whiskey on a full stomach.</em> The experiment went so well that I ordered another whiskey and poured it into more milk. That didn't seem to bother me so I tried another."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;36:3 &nbsp;Thus started one more journey to the asylum for Jim. Here was the threat of commitment, the loss of family and position, to say nothing of that intense mental and physical suffering which drinking always caused him. <em>He had much knowledge about himself as an alcoholic. Yet all reasons for not drinking were</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;37:0&nbsp; <em>easily pushed aside in favor of the foolish idea that he could take whiskey if only he mixed it with milk!</em> </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;37:1 &nbsp;Whatever the precise definition of the word may be, we call this plain insanity. How can such a lack of proportion, of the ability to think straight, be called anything else?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;37:2 &nbsp;You may think this an extreme case. To us it is not far-fetched, for this kind of thinking has been characteristic of every single one of us. We have sometimes reflected more than Jim did upon the consequences. But there was always the curious mental phenomenon that parallel with our sound reasoning there inevitably ran some insanely trivial excuse for taking the first drink. Our sound reasoning failed to hold us in check. The insane idea won out. Next day we would ask ourselves, in all earnestness and sincerity, how it could have happened.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;37:3 &nbsp;In some circumstances we have gone out deliberately to get drunk, feeling ourselves justified by nervousness, anger, worry, depression, jealousy or the like. But even in this type of beginning we are obliged to admit that our justification for a spree was insanely insufficient in the light of what always happened. We now see that when we began to drink deliberately, instead of casually, there was little serious or effective thought during the period of premeditation of what the terrific consequences might be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;37:4 &nbsp;Our behavior is as absurd and incomprehensible with respect to the first drink as that of an individual with a passion, say, for jay-walking. He gets a thrill out of skipping in front of fast-moving vehicles. He enjoys himself for a few years in spite of friendly warnings. Up to this point you would label him as a foolish &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;38:0 &nbsp;chap having queer ideas of fun. Luck then deserts him and he is slightly injured several times in succession. You would expect him, if he were normal, to cut it out. Presently he is hit again and this time has a fractured skull. Within a week after leaving the hospital a fast-moving trolley car breaks his arm. He tells you he has decided to stop jay-walking for good, but in a few weeks he breaks both legs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;38:1 &nbsp;On through the years this conduct continues, accompanied by his continual promises to be careful or to keep off the streets altogether. Finally, he can no longer work, his wife gets a divorce and he is held up to ridicule. He tries every known means to get the jay-walking idea out of his head. He shuts himself up in an asylum, hoping to mend his ways. But the day he comes out he races in front of a fire engine, which breaks his back. Such a man would be crazy, wouldn't he?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;38:2 &nbsp;You may think our illustration is too ridiculous. But is it? We, who have been through the wringer, have to admit if we substituted alcoholism for jay-walking, the illustration would fit us exactly. However intelligent we may have been in other respects, where alcohol has been involved, we have been strangely insane. It's strong language&mdash;but isn't it true?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;38:3 &nbsp;Some of you are thinking: "Yes, what you tell us is true, but it doesn't fully apply. We admit we have some of these symptoms, but we have not gone to the extremes you fellows did, nor are we likely to, for we understand ourselves so well after what you have told us that such things cannot happen again. We have not lost everything in life through drinking and we&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;39:0 &nbsp;certainly do not intend to. Thanks for the information."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;39:1 &nbsp;That may be true of certain nonalcoholic people who, though drinking foolishly and heavily at the present time, are able to stop or moderate, because their brains and bodies have not been damaged as ours were. But the actual or potential alcoholic, with hardly an exception, will be <em>absolutely unable to stop drinking on the basis of self-knowledge.</em> This is a point we wish to emphasize and re-emphasize, to smash home upon our alcoholic readers as it has been revealed to us out of bitter experience. Let us take another illustration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;39:2 &nbsp;Fred is partner in a well known accounting firm. His income is good, he has a fine home, is happily married and the father of promising children of college age. He has so attractive a personality that he makes friends with everyone. If ever there was a successful business man, it is Fred. To all appearance he is a stable, well balanced individual. Yet, he is alcoholic. We first saw Fred about a year ago in a hospital where he had gone to recover from a bad case of jitters. It was his first experience of this kind, and he was much ashamed of it. Far from admitting he was an alcoholic, he told himself he came to the hospital to rest his nerves. The doctor intimated strongly that he might be worse than he realized. For a few days he was depressed about his condition. He made up his mind to quit drinking altogether. It never occurred to him that perhaps he could not do so, in spite of his character and standing. Fred would not believe himself an alcoholic, much less accept a spiritual remedy for his problem. We told him what&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;40:0 &nbsp;we knew about alcoholism. He was interested and conceded that he had some of the symptoms, but he was a long way from admitting that he could do nothing about it himself. He was positive that this humiliating experience, plus the knowledge he had acquired, would keep him sober the rest of his life. Self-knowledge would fix it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;40:1 &nbsp;We heard no more of Fred for a while. One day we were told that he was back in the hospital. This time he was quite shaky. He soon indicated he was anxious to see us. The story he told is most instructive, for here was a chap absolutely convinced he had to stop drinking, who had no excuse for drinking, who exhibited splendid judgment and determination in all his other concerns, yet was flat on his back nevertheless.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;40:2 &nbsp;Let him tell you about it: "I was much impressed with what you fellows said about alcoholism, and I frankly did not believe it would be possible for me to drink again. I rather appreciated your ideas about the subtle insanity which precedes the first drink, but I was confident it could not happen to me after what I had learned. I reasoned I was not so far advanced as most of you fellows, that I had been usually successful in licking my other personal problems, and that I would therefore be successful where you men failed. I felt I had every right to be self-confident, that it would be only a matter of exercising my will power and keeping on guard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;40:3 &nbsp;"In this frame of mind, I went about my business and for a time all was well. I had no trouble refusing drinks, and began to wonder if I had not been making too hard work of a simple matter. One day I went to Washington to present some accounting evidence to&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;41:0 &nbsp;a government bureau. I had been out of town before during this particular dry spell, so there was nothing new about that. Physically, I felt fine. Neither did I have any pressing problems or worries. My business came off well, I was pleased and knew my partners would be too. It was the end of a perfect day, not a cloud on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;41:1 &nbsp;"I went to my hotel and leisurely dressed for dinner. <em>As I crossed the threshold of the dining room, the thought came to mind that it would be nice to have a couple of cocktails with dinner. That was all. Nothing more.</em> I ordered a cocktail and my meal. Then I ordered another cocktail. After dinner I decided to take a walk. When I returned to the hotel it struck me a highball would be fine before going to bed, so I stepped into the bar and had one. I remember having several more that night and plenty next morning. I have a shadowy recollection of being in an airplane bound for New York and of finding a friendly taxicab driver at the landing field instead of my wife. The driver escorted me about for several days. I know little of where I went or what I said and did. Then came the hospital with unbearable mental and physical suffering.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;41:2 &nbsp;"As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went carefully over that evening in Washington. <em>Not only had I been off guard, I had made no fight whatever against the first drink. This time I had not thought of the consequences at all.</em> I had commenced to drink as carelessly as though the cocktails were ginger ale. I now remembered what my alcoholic friends had told me, how they prophesied that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time and place would come&mdash;I would drink &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>42:0 &nbsp;again. They had said that though I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before some trivial reason for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and more, for what I had learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I knew from that moment that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will power and self-knowledge would not help in those strange mental blank spots. I had never been able to understand people who said that a problem had them hopelessly defeated. I knew then. It was a crushing blow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;42:1 &nbsp;"Two of the members of Alcoholics Anonymous came to see me. They grinned, which I didn't like so much, and then asked me if I thought myself alcoholic and if I were really licked this time. I had to concede both propositions. They piled on me heaps of evidence to the effect that an alcoholic mentality, such as I had exhibited in Washington, was a hopeless condition. They cited cases out of their own experience by the dozen. This process snuffed out the last flicker of conviction that I could do the job myself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;42:2 &nbsp;"Then they outlined the spiritual answer and program of action which a hundred of them had followed successfully. Though I had been only a nominal churchman, their proposals were not, intellectually, hard to swallow. But the program of action, though entirely sensible, was pretty drastic. It meant I would have to throw several lifelong conceptions out of the window. That was not easy. But the moment I made up my mind to go through with the process, I had the curious feeling that my alcoholic condition was relieved, as in fact it proved to be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;42:3 &nbsp;"Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles would solve all my problems. I have since &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>43:0 &nbsp;been brought into a way of living infinitely more satisfying and, I hope, more useful than the life I lived before. My old manner of life was by no means a bad one, but I would not exchange its best moments for the worst I have now. I would not go back to it even if I could."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;43:1 &nbsp;Fred's story speaks for itself. We hope it strikes home to thousands like him. He had felt only the first nip of the wringer. Most alcoholics have to be pretty badly mangled before they really commence to solve their problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;43:2 &nbsp;Many doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions. One of these men, staff member of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this statement to some of us: "What you say about the general hopelessness of the average alcoholic's plight is, in my opinion, correct. As to two of you men, whose stories I have heard, there is no doubt in my mind that you were 100% hopeless, apart from divine help. Had you offered yourselves as patients at this hospital, I would not have taken you, if I had been able to avoid it. People like you are too heartbreaking. Though not a religious person, I have profound respect for the spiritual approach in such cases as yours. For most cases, there is virtually no other solution."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;43:3 &nbsp;Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink. Except in a few rare cases, neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must come from a Higher Power.</p>	2024-01-24 01:24:40.017918	2024-01-24 01:24:40.017918
4	1	THERE IS A SOLUTION	2	<p>17:1 We, of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, know thousands of men and women who were once just as hopeless as Bill. Nearly all have recovered. They have solved the drink problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>17:2 We are average Americans. All sections of this country and many of its occupations are represented, as well as many political, economic, social, and religious backgrounds. We are people who normally would not mix. But there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an understanding which is indescribably wonderful. We are like the passengers of a great liner the moment after rescue from shipwreck when camaraderie, joyousness and democracy pervade the vessel from steerage to Captain's table. Unlike the feelings of the ship's passengers, however, our joy in escape from disaster does not subside as we go our individual ways. The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one element in the powerful cement which binds us. But that in itself would never have held us together as we are now joined.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>17:3 The tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution. We have a way out on which we can absolutely agree, and upon which we can join in brotherly and harmonious action. This is the great news this book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>18:1 An illness of this sort&mdash;and we have come to believe it an illness&mdash;involves those about us in a way no other human sickness can. If a person has cancer all are sorry for him and no one is angry or hurt. But not so with the alcoholic illness, for with it there goes annihilation of all the things worth while in life. It engulfs all whose lives touch the sufferer's. It brings misunderstanding, fierce resentment, financial insecurity, disgusted friends and employers, warped lives of blameless children, sad wives and parents&mdash;anyone can increase the list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>18:2 We hope this volume will inform and comfort those who are, or who may be affected. There are many.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>18:3 Highly competent psychiatrists who have dealt with us have found it sometimes impossible to persuade an alcoholic to discuss his situation without reserve. Strangely enough, wives, parents and intimate friends usually find us even more unapproachable than do the psychiatrist and the doctor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>18:4 <em>But the ex-problem drinker who has found this solution, who is properly armed with facts about himself, can generally win the entire confidence of another alcoholic in a few hours. Until such an understanding is reached, little or nothing can be accomplished.</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>18:5 That the man who is making the approach has had the same difficulty, that he obviously knows what he is talking about, that his whole deportment shouts at the new prospect that he is a man with a real answer, that he has no attitude of Holier Than Thou, nothing whatever except the sincere desire to be helpful; that there are no fees to pay, no axes to grind, no people to please, no lectures to be endured - these are the conditions&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>19:0 we have found most effective. After such an approach many take up their beds and walk again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>19:1 None of us makes a sole vocation of this work, nor do we think its effectiveness would be increased if we did. We feel that elimination of our drinking is but a beginning. A much more important demonstration of our principles lies before us in our respective homes, occupations and affairs. All of us spend much of our spare time in the sort of effort which we are going to describe. A few are fortunate enough to be so situated that they can give nearly all their time to the work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>19:2 If we keep on the way we are going there is little doubt that much good will result, but the surface of the problem would hardly be scratched. Those of us who live in large cities are overcome by the reflection that close by hundreds are dropping into oblivion every day. Many could recover if they had the opportunity we have enjoyed. How then shall we present that which has been so freely given us?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>19:3 We have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting forth the problem as we see it. We shall bring to the task our combined experience and knowledge. This should suggest a useful program for anyone concerned with a drinking problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>19:4 Of necessity there will have to be discussion of matters medical, psychiatric, social, and religious. We are aware that these matters are, from their very nature, controversial. Nothing would please us so much as to write a book which would contain no basis for contention or argument. We shall do our utmost to achieve that ideal. Most of us sense that real tolerance of other people's shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect for their opinions are attitudes which make us 20:0 more useful to others. Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>20:1 You may already have asked yourself why it is that all of us became so very ill from drinking. Doubtless you are curious to discover how and why, in the face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body. If you are an alcoholic who wants to get over it, you may already be asking&mdash;"What do I have to do?"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>20:2 It is the purpose of this book to answer such questions specifically. We shall tell you what we have done. Before going into a detailed discussion, it may be well to summarize some points as we see them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>20:3 How many times people have said to us: "I can take it or leave it alone. Why can't he?" "Why don't you drink like a gentleman or quit?" "That fellow can't handle his liquor." "Why don't you try beer and wine?" "Lay off the hard stuff." "His will power must be weak." "He could stop if he wanted to." "She's such a sweet girl, I should think he'd stop for her sake." "The doctor told him that if he ever drank again it would kill him, but there he is all lit up again."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>20:4 Now these are commonplace observations on drinkers which we hear all the time. Back of them is a world of ignorance and misunderstanding. We see that these expressions refer to people whose reactions are very different from ours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>20:5 Moderate drinkers have little trouble in giving up liquor entirely if they have good reason for it. They can take it or leave it alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>20:6 Then we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may have the habit badly enough to gradually impair&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>21:0 him physically and mentally. It may cause him to die a few years before his time. If a sufficiently strong reason&mdash;ill health, falling in love, change of environment, or the warning of a doctor&mdash;becomes operative, this man can also stop or moderate, although he may find it difficult and troublesome and may even need medical attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>21:1 But what about the real alcoholic? He may start off as a moderate drinker; he may or may not become a continuous hard drinker; but at some stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor consumption, once he starts to drink.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>21:2 Here is the fellow who has been puzzling you, especially in his lack of control. He does absurd, incredible, tragic things while drinking. He is a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He is seldom mildly intoxicated. He is always more or less insanely drunk. His disposition while drinking resembles his normal nature but little. He may be one of the finest fellows in the world. Yet let him drink for a day, and he frequently becomes disgustingly, and even dangerously anti-social. He has a positive genius for getting tight at exactly the wrong moment, particularly when some important decision must be made or engagement kept. He is often perfectly sensible and well balanced concerning everything except liquor, but in that respect he is incredibly dishonest and selfish. He often possesses special abilities, skills, and aptitudes, and has a promising career ahead of him. He uses his gifts to build up a bright outlook for his family and himself, and then pulls the structure down on his head by a senseless series of sprees. He is the fellow who goes to bed so intoxicated he ought to sleep the clock around. Yet early next&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>22:0 morning he searches madly for the bottle he misplaced the night before. If he can afford it, he may have liquor concealed all over his house to be certain no one gets his entire supply away from him to throw down the wastepipe. As matters grow worse, he begins to use a combination of high-powered sedative and liquor to quiet his nerves so he can go to work. Then comes the day when he simply cannot make it and gets drunk all over again. Perhaps he goes to a doctor who gives him morphine or some sedative with which to taper off. Then he begins to appear at hospitals and sanitariums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>22:1 This is by no means a comprehensive picture of the true alcoholic, as our behavior patterns vary. But this description should identify him roughly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>22:2 Why does he behave like this? If hundreds of experiences have shown him that one drink means another debacle with all its attendant suffering and humiliation, why is it he takes that one drink? Why can't he stay on the water wagon? What has become of the common sense and will power that he still sometimes displays with respect to other matters?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>22:3 Perhaps there never will be a full answer to these questions. Opinions vary considerably as to why the alcoholic reacts differently from normal people. We are not sure why, once a certain point is reached, little can be done for him. We cannot answer the riddle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>22:4 We know that while the alcoholic keeps away from drink, as he may do for months or years, he reacts much like other men. We are equally positive that once he takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something happens, both in the bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually impossible for him to 23:0 stop. The experience of any alcoholic will abundantly confirm this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>23:1 These observations would be academic and pointless if our friend never took the first drink, thereby setting the terrible cycle in motion. Therefore, the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body. If you ask him why he started on that last bender, the chances are he will offer you any one of a hundred alibis. Sometimes these excuses have a certain plausibility, but none of them really makes sense in the light of the havoc an alcoholic's drinking bout creates. They sound like the philosophy of the man who, having a headache, beats himself on the head with a hammer so that he can't feel the ache. If you draw this fallacious reasoning to the attention of an alcoholic, he will laugh it off, or become irritated and refuse to talk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>23:2 Once in a while he may tell the truth. And the truth, strange to say, is usually that he has no more idea why he took that first drink than you have. Some drinkers have excuses with which they are satisfied part of the time. But in their hearts they really do not know why they do it. Once this malady has a real hold, they are a baffled lot. There is the obsession that somehow, someday, they will beat the game. But they often suspect they are down for the count.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>23:3 How true this is, few realize. In a vague way their families and friends sense that these drinkers are abnormal, but everybody hopefully awaits the day when the sufferer will rouse himself from his lethargy and assert his power of will.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>23:4 The tragic truth is that if the man be a real alcoholic, the happy day may not arrive. He has lost&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>24:0 control. At a certain point in the drinking of every alcoholic, he passes into a state where the most powerful desire to stop drinking is of absolutely no avail. This tragic situation has already arrived in practically every case long before it is suspected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>24:1 <em>The fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink. Our so-called will power becomes practically nonexistent. We are unable, at certain times, to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago. We are without defense against the first drink.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>24:2 The almost certain consequences that follow taking even a glass of beer do not crowd into the mind to deter us. If these thoughts occur, they are hazy and readily supplanted with the old threadbare idea that this time we shall handle ourselves like other people. There is a complete failure of the kind of defense that keeps one from putting his hand on a hot stove.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>24:3 The alcoholic may say to himself in the most casual way, "It won't burn me this time, so here's how!" Or perhaps he doesn't think at all. How often have some of us begun to drink in this nonchalant way, and after the third or fourth, pounded on the bar and said to ourselves, "For God's sake, how did I ever get started again?" Only to have that thought supplanted by "Well, I'll stop with the sixth drink." Or "What's the use anyhow?"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>24:4 When this sort of thinking is fully established in an individual with alcoholic tendencies, he has probably placed himself beyond human aid, and unless locked up, may die or go permanently insane. These stark and ugly facts have been confirmed by legions of alcoholics&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>25:0 throughout history. But for the grace of God, there would have been thousands more convincing demonstrations. So many want to stop but cannot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>25:1 <em>There is a solution.</em> Almost none of us liked the self-searching, the leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings which the process requires for its successful consummation. But we saw that it really worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as we had been living it. When, therefore, we were approached by those in whom the problem had been solved, there was nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit of spiritual tools laid at our feet. We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>25:2 The great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe. The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>25:3 If you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe there is no middle-of-the-road solution. We were in a position where life was becoming impossible, and if we had passed into the region from which there is no return through human aid, we had but two alternatives: One was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the consciousness of our intolerable situation as best we could; and the other, to accept spiritual help. This&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>26:0 we did because we honestly wanted to, and were willing to make the effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>26:1 A certain American business man had ability, good sense, and high character. For years he had floundered from one sanitarium to another. He had consulted the best known American psychiatrists. Then he had gone to Europe, placing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the psychiatrist, Dr. Jung) who prescribed for him. Though experience had made him skeptical, he finished his treatment with unusual confidence. His physical and mental condition were unusually good. Above all, he believed he had acquired such a profound knowledge of the inner workings of his mind and its hidden springs that relapse was unthinkable. Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short time. More baffling still, he could give himself no satisfactory explanation for his fall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>26:2 So he returned to this doctor, whom he admired, and asked him point-blank why he could not recover. He wished above all things to regain self-control. He seemed quite rational and well-balanced with respect to other problems. Yet he had no control whatever over alcohol. Why was this?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>26:3 He begged the doctor to tell him the whole truth, and he got it. In the doctor's judgment he was utterly hopeless; he could never regain his position in society and he would have to place himself under lock and key or hire a bodyguard if he expected to live long. That was a great physician's opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>26:4 But this man still lives, and is a free man. He does not need a bodyguard nor is he confined. He can go anywhere on this earth where other free men may go&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>27:0 without disaster, provided he remains willing to maintain a certain simple attitude.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>27:1 Some of our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual help. Let us tell you the rest of the conversation our friend had with his doctor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>27:2 The doctor said: "You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic. I have never seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to the extent that it does in you." Our friend felt as though the gates of hell had closed on him with a clang.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>27:3 He said to the doctor, "Is there no exception?"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>27:4 "Yes," replied the doctor, "there is. Exceptions to cases such as yours have been occurring since early times. Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences. To me these occurrences are phenomena. They appear to be in the nature of huge emotional displacements and rearrangements. Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them. In fact, I have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement within you. With many individuals the methods which I employed are successful, but I have never been successful with an alcoholic of your description."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>27:5 Upon hearing this, our friend was somewhat relieved, for he reflected that, after all, he was a good church member. This hope, however, was destroyed by the doctor's telling him that while his religious convictions were very good, in his case they did not spell the necessary vital spiritual experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>28:1 Here was the terrible dilemma in which our friend found himself when he had the extraordinary experience, which as we have already told you, made him a free man.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>28:2 We, in our turn, sought the same escape with all the desperation of drowning men. What seemed at first a flimsy reed, has proved to be the loving and powerful hand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you prefer, "a design for living that really works."&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>28:3 The distinguished American psychologist, William James, in his book "Varieties of Religious Experience," indicates a multitude of ways in which men have discovered God. We have no desire to convince anyone that there is only one way by which faith can be acquired. If what we have learned and felt and seen means anything at all, it means that all of us, whatever our race, creed, or color are the children of a living Creator with whom we may form a relationship upon simple and understandable terms as soon as we are willing and honest enough to try. Those having religious affiliations will find here nothing disturbing to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over such matters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>28:4 We think it no concern of ours what religious bodies our members identify themselves with as individuals. This should be an entirely personal affair which each one decides for himself in the light of past associations, or his present choice. Not all of us join religious bodies, but most of us favor such memberships.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>28:5 In the following chapter, there appears an explanation of alcoholism, as we understand it, then a chapter addressed to the agnostic. Many who once were in this class are now among our members. Surprisingly&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>29:0 enough, we find such convictions no great obstacle to a spiritual experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>29:1 Further on, clear-cut directions are given showing how we recovered. These are followed by forty-three personal experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>29:2 Each individual, in the personal stories, describes in his own language and from his own point of view the way he established his relationship with God. These give a fair cross section of our membership and a clear-cut idea of what has actually happened in their lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>29:3 We hope no one will consider these self-revealing accounts in bad taste. Our hope is that many alcoholic men and women, desperately in need, will see these pages, and we believe that it is only by fully disclosing ourselves and our problems that they will be persuaded to say, "Yes, I am one of them too; I must have this thing."&nbsp;</p>	2024-01-24 01:05:31.018818	2024-01-24 01:27:20.974268
6	1	WE AGNOSTICS	4	<p>44:1 In the preceding chapters you have learned something of alcoholism. We hope we have made clear the distinction between the alcoholic and the nonalcoholic. If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the amount you take, you are probably alcoholic. If that be the case, you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.</p>\r\n<p>44:2 To one who feels he is an atheist or agnostic such an experience seems impossible, but to continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an alcoholic of the hopeless variety. To be doomed to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives to face.</p>\r\n<p>44:3 But it isn't so difficult. About half our original fellowship were of exactly that type. At first some of us tried to avoid the issue, hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after a while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual basis of life&mdash;or else. Perhaps it is going to be that way with you. But cheer up, something like half of us thought we were atheists or agnostics. Our experience shows that you need not be disconcerted.</p>\r\n<p>44:4 If a mere code of morals or a better philosophy of life were sufficient to overcome alcoholism, many of us</p>\r\n<p>45:0 would have recovered long ago. But we found that such codes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how much we tried. We could wish to be moral, we could wish to be philosophically comforted, in fact, we could will these things with all our might, but the needed power wasn't there. Our human resources, as marshalled by the will, were not sufficient; they failed utterly.</p>\r\n<p>45:1 Lack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a power by which we could live, and it had to be a <em>Power greater than ourselves.</em> Obviously. But where and how were we to find this Power?</p>\r\n<p>45:2 Well, that's exactly what this book is about. Its main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem. That means we have written a book which we believe to be spiritual as well as moral. And it means, of course, that we are going to talk about God. Here difficulty arises with agnostics. Many times we talk to a new man and watch his hope rise as we discuss his alcoholic problems and explain our fellowship. But his face falls when we speak of spiritual matters, especially when we mention God, for we have re-opened a subject which our man thought he had neatly evaded or entirely ignored.</p>\r\n<p>45:3 We know how he feels. We have shared his honest doubt and prejudice. Some of us have been violently anti-religious. To others, the word "God" brought up a particular idea of Him with which someone had tried to impress them during childhood. Perhaps we rejected this particular conception because it seemed inadequate. With that rejection we imagined we had abandoned the God idea entirely. We were bothered</p>\r\n<p>46:0 with the thought that faith and dependence upon a Power beyond ourselves was somewhat weak, even cowardly. We looked upon this world of warring individuals, warring theological systems, and inexplicable calamity, with deep skepticism. We looked askance at many individuals who claimed to be godly. How could a Supreme Being have anything to do with it all? And who could comprehend a Supreme Being anyhow? Yet, in other moments, we found ourselves thinking, when enchanted by a starlit night, "Who, then, made all this?" There was a feeling of awe and wonder, but it was fleeting and soon lost.</p>\r\n<p>46:1 Yes, we of agnostic temperament have had these thoughts and experiences. Let us make haste to reassure you. We found that as soon as we were able to lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a Power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that Power, which is God.</p>\r\n<p>46:2 Much to our relief, we discovered we did not need to consider another's conception of God. Our own conception, however inadequate, was sufficient to make the approach and to effect a contact with Him. As soon as we admitted the possible existence of a Creative Intelligence, a Spirit of the Universe underlying the totality of things, we began to be possessed of a new sense of power and direction, provided we took other simple steps. We found that God does not make too hard terms with those who seek Him. To us, the Realm of Spirit is broad, roomy, all inclusive; never exclusive or forbidding to those who earnestly seek. It is open, we believe, to all men.</p>\r\n<p>47:1 When, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God. This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions which you find in this book. Do not let any prejudice you may have against spiritual terms deter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean to you. At the start, this was all we needed to commence spiritual growth, to effect our first conscious relation with God as we understood Him. Afterward, we found ourselves accepting many things which then seemed entirely out of reach. That was growth, but if we wished to grow we had to begin somewhere. So we used our own conception, however limited it was.</p>\r\n<p>47:2 We needed to ask ourselves but one short question. "Do I now believe, or am I even willing to believe, that there is a Power greater than myself?" As soon as a man can say that he does believe, or is willing to believe, we emphatically assure him that he is on his way. It has been repeatedly proven among us that upon this simple cornerstone a wonderfully effective spiritual structure can be built.</p>\r\n<p>47:3 That was great news to us, for we had assumed we could not make use of spiritual principles unless we accepted many things on faith which seemed difficult to believe. When people presented us with spiritual approaches, how frequently did we all say, "I wish I had what that man has. I'm sure it would work if I could only believe as he believes. But I cannot accept as surely true the many articles of faith which are so plain to him." So it was comforting to learn that we could commence at a simpler level.</p>\r\n<p>47:4 Besides a seeming inability to accept much on faith,</p>\r\n<p>48:0 we often found ourselves handicapped by obstinacy, sensitiveness, and unreasoning prejudice. Many of us have been so touchy that even casual reference to spiritual things made us bristle with antagonism. This sort of thinking had to be abandoned. Though some of us resisted, we found no great difficulty in casting aside such feelings. Faced with alcoholic destruction, we soon became as open minded on spiritual matters as we had tried to be on other questions. In this respect alcohol was a great persuader. It finally beat us into a state of reasonableness. Sometimes this was a tedious process; we hope no one else will be prejudiced for as long as some of us were.</p>\r\n<p>48:1 The reader may still ask why he should believe in a Power greater than himself. We think there are good reasons. Let us have a look at some of them.</p>\r\n<p>48:2 The practical individual of today is a stickler for facts and results. Nevertheless, the twentieth century readily accepts theories of all kinds, provided they are firmly grounded in fact. We have numerous theories, for example, about electricity. Everybody believes them without a murmur of doubt. Why this ready acceptance? Simply because it is impossible to explain what we see, feel, direct, and use, without a reasonable assumption as a starting point.</p>\r\n<p>48:3 Everybody nowadays, believes in scores of assumptions for which there is good evidence, but no perfect visual proof. And does not science demonstrate that visual proof is the weakest proof? It is being constantly revealed, as mankind studies the material world, that outward appearances are not inward reality at all. To illustrate:</p>\r\n<p>48:4 The prosaic steel girder is a mass of electrons whirling</p>\r\n<p>49:0 around each other at incredible speed. These tiny bodies are governed by precise laws, and these laws hold true throughout the material world. Science tells us so. We have no reason to doubt it. When, however, the perfectly logical assumption is suggested that underneath the material world and life as we see it, there is an All Powerful, Guiding, Creative Intelligence, right there our perverse streak comes to the surface and we laboriously set out to convince ourselves it isn't so. We read wordy books and indulge in windy arguments, thinking we believe this universe needs no God to explain it. Were our contentions true, it would follow that life originated out of nothing, means nothing, and proceeds nowhere.</p>\r\n<p>49:1 Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe that our human intelligence was the last word, the alpha and the omega, the beginning and end of all. Rather vain of us, wasn't it?</p>\r\n<p>49:2 We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice, even against organized religion. We have learned that whatever the human frailties of various faiths may be, those faiths have given purpose and direction to millions. People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about. Actually, we used to have no reasonable conception whatever. We used to amuse ourselves by cynically dissecting spiritual beliefs and practices when we might have observed that many spiritually-minded persons of all races, colors, and creeds were demonstrating a degree of stability, happiness and usefulness which we should have sought ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>50:1 Instead, we looked at the human defects of these people, and sometimes used their shortcomings as a basis of wholesale condemnation. We talked of intolerance, while we were intolerant ourselves. We missed the reality and the beauty of the forest because we were diverted by the ugliness of some of its trees. We never gave the spiritual side of life a fair hearing.</p>\r\n<p>50:2 In our personal stories you will find a wide variation in the way each teller approaches and conceives of the Power which is greater than himself. Whether we agree with a particular approach or conception seems to make little difference. Experience has taught us that these are matters about which, for our purpose, we need not be worried. They are questions for each individual to settle for himself.</p>\r\n<p>50:3 On one proposition, however, these men and women are strikingly agreed. Every one of them has gained access to, and believes in, a Power greater than himself. This Power has in each case accomplished the miraculous, the humanly impossible. As a celebrated American statesman put it, "Let's look at the record."</p>\r\n<p>50:4 Here are thousands of men and women, worldly indeed. They flatly declare that since they have come to believe in a Power greater than themselves, to take a certain attitude toward that Power, and to do certain simple things, there has been a revolutionary change in their way of living and thinking. In the face of collapse and despair, in the face of the total failure of their human resources, they found that a new power, peace, happiness, and sense of direction flowed into them. This happened soon after they wholeheartedly met a few simple requirements. Once confused</p>\r\n<p>51:0 and baffled by the seeming futility of existence, they show the underlying reasons why they were making heavy going of life. Leaving aside the drink question, they tell why living was so unsatisfactory. They show how the change came over them. When many hundreds of people are able to say that the consciousness of the Presence of God is today the most important fact of their lives, they present a powerful reason why one should have faith.</p>\r\n<p>51:1 This world of ours has made more material progress in the last century than in all the millenniums which went before. Almost everyone knows the reason. Students of ancient history tell us that the intellect of men in those days was equal to the best of today. Yet in ancient times material progress was painfully slow. The spirit of modern scientific inquiry, research and invention was almost unknown. In the realm of the material, men's minds were fettered by superstition, tradition, and all sorts of fixed ideas. Some of the contemporaries of Columbus thought a round earth preposterous. Others came near putting Galileo to death for his astronomical heresies.</p>\r\n<p>51:2 We asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just as biased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit as were the ancients about the realm of the material? Even in the present century, American newspapers were afraid to print an account of the Wright brothers' first successful flight at Kitty Hawk. Had not all efforts at flight failed before? Did not Professor Langley's flying machine go to the bottom of the Potomac River? Was it not true that the best mathematical minds had proved man could never fly? Had not people said God had reserved this privilege to the</p>\r\n<p>52:0 birds? Only thirty years later the conquest of the air was almost an old story and airplane travel was in full swing.</p>\r\n<p>52:1 But in most fields our generation has witnessed complete liberation of our thinking. Show any longshoreman a Sunday supplement describing a proposal to explore the moon by means of a rocket and he will say "I bet they do it&mdash;maybe not so long either." Is not our age characterized by the ease with which we discard old ideas for new, by the complete readiness with which we throw away the theory or gadget which does not work for something new which does?</p>\r\n<p>52:2 We had to ask ourselves why we shouldn't apply to our human problems this same readiness to change our point of view. We were having trouble with personal relationships, we couldn't control our emotional natures, we were a prey to misery and depression, we couldn't make a living, we had a feeling of uselessness, we were full of fear, we were unhappy, we couldn't seem to be of real help to other people&mdash;was not a basic solution of these bedevilments more important than whether we should see newsreels of lunar flight? Of course it was.</p>\r\n<p>52:3 When we saw others solve their problems by a simple reliance upon the Spirit of the Universe, we had to stop doubting the power of God. Our ideas did not work. But the God idea did.</p>\r\n<p>52:4 The Wright brothers' almost childish faith that they could build a machine which would fly was the main- spring of their accomplishment. Without that, nothing could have happened. We agnostics and atheists were sticking to the idea that self-sufficiency would solve our problems. When others showed us that "God-sufficiency</p>\r\n<p>53:0 worked with them, we began to feel like those who had insisted the Wrights would never fly.</p>\r\n<p>53:1 Logic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not by chance we were given the power to reason, to examine the evidence of our senses, and to draw conclusions. That is one of man's magnificent attributes. We agnostically inclined would not feel satisfied with a proposal which does not lend itself to reasonable approach and interpretation. Hence we are at pains to tell why we think our present faith is reasonable, why we think it more sane and logical to believe than not to believe, why we say our former thinking was soft and mushy when we threw up our hands in doubt and said, "We don't know."</p>\r\n<p>53:2 When we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crisis we could not postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything or else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn't. What was our choice to be?</p>\r\n<p>53:3 Arrived at this point, we were squarely confronted with the question of faith. We couldn't duck the issue. Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh courage to flagging spirits. Friendly hands had stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason had brought us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore. Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and we did not like to lose our support.</p>\r\n<p>53:4 That was natural, but let us think a little more closely. Without knowing it, had we not been brought to where we stood by a certain kind of faith? For did</p>\r\n<p>54:0 we not believe in our own reasoning? Did we not have confidence in our ability to think? What was that but a sort of faith? Yes, we had been faithful, abjectly faithful to the God of Reason. So, in one way or another, we discovered that faith had been involved all the time!</p>\r\n<p>54:1 We found, too, that we had been worshippers. What a state of mental goose-flesh that used to bring on! Had we not variously worshipped people, sentiment, things, money, and ourselves? And then, with a better motive, had we not worshipfully beheld the sunset, the sea, or a flower? Who of us had not loved something or somebody? How much did these feelings, these loves, these worships, have to do with pure reason? Little or nothing, we saw at last. Were not these things the tissue out of which our lives were constructed? Did not these feelings, after all, determine the course of our existence? It was impossible to say we had no capacity for faith, or love, or worship. In one form or another we had been living by faith and little else.</p>\r\n<p>54:2 Imagine life without faith! Were nothing left but pure reason, it wouldn't be life. But we believed in life&mdash;of course we did. We could not prove life in the sense that you can prove a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, yet, there it was. Could we still say the whole thing was nothing but a mass of electrons, created out of nothing, meaning nothing, whirling on to a destiny of nothingness? Of course we couldn't. The electrons themselves seemed more intelligent than that. At least, so the chemist said.</p>\r\n<p>54:3 Hence, we saw that reason isn't everything. Neither is reason, as most of us use it, entirely dependable,</p>\r\n<p>55:0 though it emanate from our best minds. What about people who proved that man could never fly?</p>\r\n<p>55:1 Yet we had been seeing another kind of flight, a spiritual liberation from this world, people who rose above their problems. They said God made these things possible, and we only smiled. We had seen spiritual release, but liked to tell ourselves it wasn't true.</p>\r\n<p>55:2 Actually we were fooling ourselves, for deep down in every man, woman, and child, is the fundamental idea of God. It may be obscured by calamity, by pomp, by worship of other things, but in some form or other it is there. For faith in a Power greater than ourselves, and miraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives, are facts as old as man himself.</p>\r\n<p>55:3 We finally saw that faith in some kind of God was a part of our make-up, just as much as the feeling we have for a friend. Sometimes we had to search fearlessly, but He was there. He was as much a fact as we were. We found the Great Reality deep down within us. In the last analysis it is only there that He may be found. It was so with us.</p>\r\n<p>55:4 We can only clear the ground a bit. If our testimony helps sweep away prejudice, enables you to think honestly, encourages you to search diligently within yourself, then, if you wish, you can join us on the Broad Highway. With this attitude you cannot fail. The consciousness of your belief is sure to come to you.</p>\r\n<p>55:5 In this book you will read the experience of a man who thought he was an atheist. His story is so interesting that some of it should be told now. His change of heart was dramatic, convincing, and moving. 56:1 Our friend was a minister's son. He attended church school, where he became rebellious at what he thought an overdose of religious education. For years thereafter he was dogged by trouble and frustration. Business failure, insanity, fatal illness, suicide&mdash;these calamities in his immediate family embittered and depressed him. Post-war disillusionment, ever more serious alcoholism, impending mental and physical collapse, brought him to the point of self-destruction.</p>\r\n<p>56:2 One night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached by an alcoholic who had known a spiritual experience. Our friend's gorge rose as he bitterly cried out: "If there is a God, He certainly hasn't done anything for me!" But later, alone in his room, he asked himself this question: "Is it possible that all the religious people I have known are wrong?" While pondering the answer he felt as though he lived in hell. Then, like a thunderbolt, a great thought came. It crowded out all else:</p>\r\n<p>56:3 "<em>Who are you to say there is no God?</em>"</p>\r\n<p>56:4 This man recounts that he tumbled out of bed to his knees. In a few seconds he was overwhelmed by a conviction of the Presence of God. It poured over and through him with the certainty and majesty of a great tide at flood. The barriers he had built through the years were swept away. He stood in the Presence of Infinite Power and Love. He had stepped from bridge to shore. For the first time, he lived in conscious companionship with his Creator.</p>\r\n<p>56:5 Thus was our friend's cornerstone fixed in place. No later vicissitude has shaken it. His alcoholic problem was taken away. That very night, years ago, it disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>57:0 Save for a few brief moments of temptation the thought of drink has never returned; and at such times a great revulsion has risen up in him. Seemingly he could not drink even if he would. God had restored his sanity.</p>\r\n<p>57:1 What is this but a miracle of healing? Yet its elements are simple. Circumstances made him willing to believe. He humbly offered himself to his Maker&mdash;then he knew.</p>\r\n<p>57:2 Even so has God restored us all to our right minds. To this man, the revelation was sudden. Some of us grow into it more slowly. But He has come to all who have honestly sought Him.</p>\r\n<p>57:3 When we drew near to Him He disclosed Himself to us!</p>\r\n<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>	2024-01-24 03:22:16.594622	2024-01-24 06:24:02.233683

But all who are in the least reasonable will agree upon one point: that there is plenty wrong with us alcoholics about which plenty will have to be done if we are to expect sobriety, progress, and any real ability to cope with life.\\"}]},{\\"type\\":\\"paragraph\\",\\"attrs\\":{\\"textAlign\\":\\"left\\"},\\"content\\":[{\\"type\\":\\"text\\",\\"text\\":\\"To avoid falling into confusion over the names these defects should be called, let's take a universally recognized list of major human failings—the Seven Deadly Sins of pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. It is not by accident that pride heads the procession. For pride, leading to self-justification, and always spurred by conscious or unconscious fears, is the basic breeder of most human difficulties, the chief block to true progress. Pride lures us into making demands upon ourselves or upon others which cannot be met without perverting or misusing our God-given instincts. When the satisfaction of our instincts for sex, security, and society becomes the sole object of our lives, then pride steps in to justify our excesses.\\"}]},{\\"type\\":\\"paragraph\\",\\"attrs\\":{\\"textAlign\\":\\"left\\"},\\"content\\":[{\\"type\\":\\"text\\",\\"text\\":\\"All these failings generate fear, a soul-sickness in its own right. Then fear, in turn, generates more character defects. Unreasonable fear that our instincts will not be satisfied drives us to covet the possessions of others, to lust for sex and power, to become angry when our instinctive demands are threatened, to be envious when the ambitions of others seem to be realized while ours are not. We eat, drink, and grab for more of everything than we need, fearing we shall never have enough. And with genuine alarm at the prospect of work, we stay lazy. We loaf and procrastinate, or at best work grudgingly and under half steam. These fears are the termites that ceaselessly devour the foundations of whatever sort of life we try to build.\\"}]},{\\"type\\":\\"paragraph\\",\\"attrs\\":{\\"textAlign\\":\\"left\\"},\\"content\\":[{\\"type\\":\\"text\\",\\"text\\":\\"So when A.A. suggests a fearless moral inventory, it must seem to every newcomer that more is being asked of him than he can do. Both his pride and his fear beat him back every time he tries to look within himself. Pride says, “You need not pass this way,” and Fear says, “You dare not look!” But the testimony of A.A.'s who have really tried a moral inventory is that pride and fear of this sort turn out to be bogeymen, nothing else. Once we have a complete willingness to take inventory, and exert ourselves to do the job thoroughly, a wonderful light falls upon this foggy scene. As we persist, a brand-new kind of confidence is born, and the sense of relief at finally facing ourselves is indescribable. These are the first fruits of Step Four.\\"}]}]}"	Reading	88	2025-04-05 01:06:14.468673	2025-04-05 01:54:54.240488

Living one day at a time; Enjoying one moment at a time; Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; Taking, as He did, this sinful world As it is, not as I would have it; Trusting that He will make things right If I surrender to His Will; So that I may be reasonably happy in this life And supremely happy with Him Forever and ever in the next. Amen.”	\N	\N
